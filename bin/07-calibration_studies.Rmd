BDS tasks represent a classic measure of WM (Case & Globerson, 1974). Participants must remember an ordered sequence of digits, mentally reverse it, and enter the reversed sequence by clicking the numbers on a key- pad. We reimplemented the version used by Vock and Holling (2008), which consisted of 12 trials of increas- ing difficulty using sequences of four to seven digits length. Since all stimuli were presented in the visual domain and responding involved clicking digits on a visually displayed keypad that spatially organized the digits, we consider this a visuospatial BDS task. Previous item response theory (IRT) models for this task could not be used as they were constructed based on their inclusion in another battery of tasks (as explained above). We computed IRT scores for each participant by fitting a Rasch psychometric model to the collected data. A Pearson’s product-moment correlation of the sum scores with the IRT scores yielded a very strong correlation (r 1⁄4 .99, p < .01), indicating a high level of
consistency between the classical test theory and IRT scoring methods.
