## Historical Background: Approaches to Improving Playing by Ear in Jazz Music {#historical_background}


Jazz music began as an oral tradition where skills were developed through listening and imitation rather than formal instruction. The development of aural skills to support improvisation (i.e., playing by ear") — has been a central feature of learning jazz music throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In this section, I describe the historical evolution of approaches to developing aural skills in jazz music. I survey how record players, transcription books, and pattern books have supported the ear training process in jazz music and the evolving interplay between informal, aural traditions and formalised, institutional methods. This suggests a gradual shift from purely aural learning to increasingly systematised approaches, reflecting broader trends in the institutionalisation of jazz education. Despite this evolution, the fundamental importance of developing acute listening skills remains central to effective jazz pedagogy and discourse.

### The Aural Origins of Jazz Education

The early history of jazz was characterised by learning that occurred primarily through aural means involving "hours of listening, transcribing, and participating in jam sessions" [@herzig2019abc] before formal educational approaches emerged. In this pre-institutional era, the transmission of jazz knowledge occurred organically within communities of practice, with experienced musicians serving as mentors to aspiring players. This master-apprentice relationship formed the foundation of early jazz pedagogy, where direct demonstration and immediate repetition were the primary teaching methods. The absence of formal jazz education in the early period necessitated the aural approach, as musicians needed to develop their skills through direct engagement with the music itself. While some things were written down, such as Downbeat magasine transcriptions in the 1940's [@kogerFiftyYearsBeat1985], the vast majority of what people learned and played was done solely "by ear". This established a precedent that would continue to influence jazz pedagogy, even as more formalised approaches developed. The emphasis on learning by ear ensured that early jazz musicians developed strong aural skills as a natural consequence of their training process.

### Record Players as Pedagogical Tools

The development of recording technology dramatically transformed jazz education by making the music of master performers accessible to aspiring musicians regardless of geographic location. Recordings became essential educational resources, allowing students to study the repertoire and improvisations of established artists [@butterfield2002music; @re2004role]. This technological advancement democratised access to jazz education, extending learning opportunities beyond those who could physically attend performances or study with established musicians. Technologies such as variable-speed turntables and digital audio software enabled closer analysis, allowing students to slow down recordings for detailed ear training [@re2004role]. Listening became active engagement, with learners looping short segments, replicating phrases, and attempting to match phrasing and articulation. The ability to repeatedly listen to recorded performances proved particularly valuable, especially since records could be "endlessly repeated" [@surberRecordProgressionsTechnology2009]. This repetition allowed students to internalise not only melodies and chord progressions but also nuances of style, tone, and expression that are difficult to communicate through written notation. The practice of slowing down recordings or lifting the needle to replay difficult passages became standard pedagogical techniques that allowed for deep analysis of complex musical passages. @berliner1994thinking emphasises that imitation from recordings helped players build a mental library of harmonic and melodic ideas, forming a foundation for improvisation.

The phonograph (and later recording techologies e.g., CDs, MP3s etc.) thus become an indispensable tool for jazz learners. Listening to records enabled musicians to internalise jazz language and style. Even as jazz moved into universities, listening retained primacy. As @wilf2012rituals describes, jazz education features "rituals" that centre around repeated listening to and playing along with canonical recordings. These practices continue to uphold the oral traditions at the heart of jazz pedagogy.


### Codification of Jazz Education


The transition from purely aural learning to more systematised approaches began in the mid-20th century. @herzig2019abc identifies the 1930s as a pivotal period, with early attempts to codify jazz instruction including @beihoffCourseModernArranging1934's "Modern Arranging and Orchestration" and Lee Bowden's training program for Afro-American Service Musicians at the Great Lakes Naval Base (1942-45). These initial efforts to systematise jazz education represented the beginning of a shift toward more formalised and codified instructional approaches, though they remained relatively limited in scope. However, the rise of printed transcription books - like the *Charlie Parker Omnibook* in the 1970's [@parkerCharlieParkerOmnibook2009] - introduced shifts in practice. While these books provided accessible models for study, @witmer1988historical argued that many early transcription collections failed to support active listening, with students relying more on notation rather than using their ears. Generally, transcription is thought most effective when used in tandem with active listening: students should first attempt to transcribe by ear and then use notated versions for verification or analysis [@berliner1994thinking; @re2004role]


### The Chord-Scale Approach, Pattern Books, and Melodic Vocabulary Acquisition

A watershed moment in jazz education came in the late 1960s, with what @herzig2019abc terms "the ABCs of jazz" - referring to the influential work of Jamey Aebersold, David Baker, and Jerry Coker. Their development of comprehensive instructional materials, including @bakerJazzImprovisationComprehensive1969's "Jazz Improvisation: a Comprehensive Method for all Players" and Aebersold's play-along recordings, established a framework for jazz education that continues to influence pedagogical approaches today. These materials helped standardise jazz instruction and made it more accessible to students without direct access to master performers, contributing to what @proutyHistoryJazzEducation2005 describes pejoratively as the "wholesale growth" of jazz education during the 1960s and 70s.


The chord-scale approach pioneered by Baker, Aebersold, and Coker became a dominant paradigm in jazz education. These influential educators "focus on scales and modes to examine improvisation" [@spiceLiteratureReviewJazz2010]. This approach provided students with systematic frameworks for navigating harmonic structures, offering concrete tools for developing improvisational facility. The emphasis on scales and patterns created a more accessible entry point for students transitioning from classical training to jazz improvisation.

Aebersold's own description of his pedagogical evolution reveals the gradual systematisation of his approach: "I published my first jazz play-a-long in 1967 and the [accompanying] booklet included concert [key] chords for each track. Subsequent printings added transposed chord symbols [for Bb and Eb instruments] and, eventually, I added the needed transposed scales and chords for each track" [@herzig2019abc]. This approach represented a compromise between purely aural learning and more visually-oriented instructional methods, coupling "the eye with the ear" in ways that provided students with multiple pathways for internalising jazz vocabulary. The development of pattern books and play-along recordings created standardised resources that facilitated the institutional teaching of jazz improvisation.

Pattern books, such as Coker’s *Patterns for Jazz* and Baker’s *Improvisational Patterns*, systematised jazz vocabulary through short, transposable licks and exercises. While @witmer1988historical recognises their role in helping students internalise chord-scale relationships and idiomatic phrases, these tools also sparked criticism. @benward1984jazz caution that over-reliance on such methods can yield formulaic improvisation disconnected from the spontaneous, reactive nature of jazz. @wilf2012rituals views pattern books as part of a broader institutional shift from an oral tradition to a codified curriculum. Proponents of such methods like @coker1964improvising emphasised that such resources should be integrated with listening and improvisation, rather than standing in as a replacement. In this way, practising melodic patterns can be used as an ear-training aid by helping to reinforce melodic shapes and harmonic contexts, provided that students also engage with recordings and creative application. It is for this reason that many pattern books are also presented with isorhythmic melodies; as noted in the introduction to @cokerPatternsJazzTheory1999:

> Most of the patterns contained herein are presented in eighth notes (the rhythmic level of most jazz improvisation), in a continuing fashion, without rhythmic variation, and without rhythmic phrase-endings. This was an arbitrary approach, so as not to dictate what the rhythms should be. nor to restrict them to a single rhythmic approach. When the practiced patterns are applied to an improvisation. it is expected that the rhythms would be loosened, so that the idea takes on a more lyrical, natural, and less mechanical feeling.



### John Coltrane and Slonimsky's Thesaurus: Aspirational Melodic Vocabulary Acquisition

John Coltrane's approach to improvisation, characterised by systematic exploration of harmonic possibilities, had a profound impact on jazz pedagogy. Musicological research examining Coltrane's melodic vocabulary suggests his methodological approach to developing improvisational frameworks, including his systematic exploration of harmonic structures through patterns and exercises [e.g., @bertholf2014coltrane; @martinExpandingJazzTonality2012; @ogallagherPitchClassSetUsage2020]. Coltrane's disciplined practice methods and innovative harmonic concepts established new paradigms for jazz improvisation that would later be incorporated into educational approaches, showing how his influence extended beyond his specific musical innovations to encompass his overall approach to musical development. 

Coltrane's systematic exploration of musical possibilities demonstrated the value of structured practice and theoretical understanding alongside intuitive improvisation. Scholars have analysed Coltrane's use of pitch-class sets and other patterns [@ogallagherPitchClassSetUsage2020], noting the probable influence of Slonimsky's *Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns* [referred to as Slonimsky’s *Thesaurus*, for short; @slonimskyThesaurusScalesMelodic1947] by the Russian-American composer Nicolas Slonimsky who was "obsessed with twelve-tone rows" [@feisstSchoenbergsNewWorld2011; @slonimskyPerfectPitchLife1988]. The *Thesaurus* was a seminal book in music theory. As suggested by its title, the book is an exhaustive collection of melodies which Slonimsky laboriously generated manually and systematically. The purpose of such a volume was to provide a repository of melodies which breaks free of traditional tonal harmonic principles. In other words, it was an attempt to systematically open up possibilities in the Western music system which had not yet been explored (for later similar approaches see e.g., @johnsonOtherHarmonyTonal2014). 

Slonimsky’s undertaking can be viewed as a way of codifying and unlocking the potential of melodic possibilities through systematisation. It highlights that by using algorithimic thinking, new possibilities can be unlocked. One basic principle behind Slonimsky’s systematisation was to divide one or more octaves of the twelve-tone system into symmetrical intervals and from there systematically interpolate different numbers of notes between the intervals created by the divisions. Additionally, he used other formulae to generate melodic patterns which had not yet been yielded by his basic scheme. Of *The Thesaurus*, the Second Viennese School composer Arnold Schoenberg wrote to Slonimsky, *"you might [have] in all probability organized every possible succession of tones"* and referred to his work as "an admirable feast of mental gymnastics" (from the blurb of the book). Whilst the former is almost certainly not true (unless constrained to a length, the number of possible melodies are infinite), the latter is undoubtedly. However, such a task would now be solved at ease by a script on a modern computer, partly motivating this research project.

The *Thesaurus* thus represents a significant intersection between theoretical systems and jazz improvisation. Although originally conceived as a classical resource, the text became influential among jazz musicians beyong Coltrane (including Frank Zappa, for instance; @slonimskyPerfectPitchLife1988) seeking to expand their improvisational vocabulary by enabling a systematic approaches to exploring melodic possibilities within the twelve-tone chromatic scale.
The application of these patterns to jazz contexts demonstrates how theoretical systems can be adapted to serve improvisational purposes, expanding the vocabulary available to jazz improvisers while maintaining connections to the oral tradition. Coltrane exemplifies this duality of pushing the boundaries; whilst exploring new, avant-grade melodic language, he continued to play jazz standards live at concerts even late into his career. Similar "boundary pushing" melodic vocabularies in the jazz literature are Yuseff Lateef's *Repository of Scales and Melodic Patterns* [@lateefRepositoryScalesMelodic2015] and works by Masaya Yamaguchi such as *The Complete Thesaurus of Musical Scales* [@yamaguchiCompleteThesaurusMusical2006] and *Lexicon of Geometric Patterns for Jazz Improvisation* [@yamaguchiLexiconGeometricPatterns2011].


Note that, Coltrane's use of Slonimsky's *Thesaurus* represents a desire to move from simply "learning the oral jazz tradition" to developing novel melodic ideas. This is an important distinction to be made and represent two kinds of approaches to acquiring melodic representations for improvisational jazz music. The first, is about "learning the tradition" - transcribing important historical elements of jazz language; specific jazz licks etc. Such language acquisition is more pedagogical, using "tried-and-tested" patterns which helps play within idiomatic jazz frameworks (e.g., particular chord changes/jazz standards). I term the latter approach about acquiring novel melodic vocabularies, "*aspirational melodic vocabularies*" representing that the intention behind their acquisition is about pushing creative boundaries and finding new and exciting melodic combinations. This melodic space is virtually infinite, but exciting to explore for improvisers looking to develop a personal melodic style. There are thus two potential use cases when thinking about the development of a training program. The first for developing idiomatic jazz language will be of interest to beginners and experts alike, but the second, aspirational melodic vocabulary acquisition will generally only be of interest to experts.


### Historical Background: Conclusion 

Record players, transcription books, and pattern books have each contributed to jazz ear training across the 20th and 21st centuries. Sociocultural/historical perspectives affirm that while written and technological resources are valuable, they should be embedded in a pedagogy that privileges listening, in accordance with the "jazz tradition". The most enduring jazz learning strategies would suggest that tools are integrated into a broader aural framework, preserving the tradition of learning music by ear, even in the context of modern jazz education codification.

The historical development of approaches to improving playing by ear in jazz pedagogy reveals a gradual evolution from purely aural learning to increasingly systematised methods. As the revered saxophonist Liebman argues in his discussion of transcription practices, this process involves "a three part learning process: body, mind and spirit-in that order" [@CompleteTranscriptionProcess2006]. Whether we disgard the mysticism or not, this represents a holistic view often shared in jazz musician circles which recognises that effective ear training integrates physical, intellectual, and intuitive aspects of musical development, reflecting the multifaceted nature of jazz improvisation itself.

The continued evolution of ear training approaches in jazz education reflects broader trends in the field, balancing respect for traditional aural learning with recognition of the benefits offered by more systematised methods and technological tools. This integration of approaches provides contemporary students with multiple pathways for developing the aural skills essential to effective jazz performance. As jazz education continues to evolve, maintaining this balance between aural tradition and systematised instruction remains a central challenge and opportunity for jazz pedagogy.

The adoption of melodic thesaruses, such as the exhaustive algorithmic work of Slonimsky's illustrates how jazz education has drawn from diverse sources beyond the jazz tradition itself. This connection between Coltrane's innovative improvisational approach and Slonimsky's theoretical work illustrates the emerging synthesis between systematised approaches and creative expression in jazz education.
