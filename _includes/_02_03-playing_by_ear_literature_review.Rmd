## Playing by Ear Research: A Literature Review {#playing_by_ear_literature_review}

In this section, I provide an overview of the literature on playing by ear mainly coming from the music psychology and music education literature, focusing on three key areas: (1) cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying playing by ear, (2) developmental and pedagogical aspects of acquiring playing by ear skills, and (3) practical strategies and individual differences in learning and applying playing by ear, including insights from jazz and professional musicians.


### Cognitive and Neural Mechanisms Underlying Playing by Ear

**Auditory Imagery and Mental Representation**: A central cognitive component of playing by ear is auditory imagery – the ability to internally hear or imagine music without external sound. Skilled ear-players exhibit strong auditory imagery capacities, which enable them to anticipate and mentally "hear" pitches and phrases before playing them. Cognitive studies have found that auditory imagery can guide performance by activating sensorimotor representations: imagining sounds that correspond to specific instrumental actions can trigger the motor programs for those actions [@novembreConceptualReviewActionperception2014]. In other words, when an experienced musician internally hears a melody, that imagery is closely coupled with the fingerings or movements needed to produce it.

This aligns with the concept of audiation in music education [@gordon2001; @gordonLearningSequencesMusic2007], whereby musicians "hear" music in their mind as a precursor to performing it. Neuroimaging evidence further supports this auditory–motor linkage. For example, studies show that simply imagining musical sequences engages regions of the brain’s motor planning network in trained musicians [@novembreConceptualReviewActionperception2014]. @kellerMentalImageryMusic2012 noted that mental imagery in music performance serves important functions such as planning upcoming notes and monitoring intonation. In the context of playing by ear, expert musicians form rich mental representations of pieces, often encoding not just the melodic contour but also harmonic and structural features. Research by @woody2020 demonstrated that musicians highly skilled in ear-playing use "harmonically oriented integrated cognitive strategies," whereas less experienced ear-players rely on more fragmentary, note-by-note approaches [@woody2020 ]. In Woody’s study, university music students who were guided to focus on a melody’s underlying chord progression developed a more substantive "goal image" of the tune, which in turn improved their ability to learn it by ear. This indicates that adding harmonic context to one’s auditory imagery (for instance, knowing the chord changes) leads to more robust mental representations and facilitates ear-playing. Thus, proficient playing by ear involves vivid auditory imagery and schema-like memory for musical patterns, especially harmonic frameworks.

**Working Memory and Anticipation**: Playing music by ear also engages working memory and long-term memory in unique ways. Musicians must temporarily hold incoming auditory information (the sounds just heard) while simultaneously planning and executing motor responses on their instrument. This places demands on the phonological loop (for retaining pitch sequences) as well as the integration of auditory and motor memory. Studies have explored how working memory for musical material might differ between those who rely on ear-playing and those who rely on notation. @Nichols2018 compared jazz and classically trained musicians on auditory working memory tasks and found notable differences. Jazz players – who typically emphasise learning by ear – outperformed classical players in remembering and reproducing heard melodies, especially when they had to play back the melodies on an instrument. In this study, musicians were asked to recall the final notes of sequences after a distraction, either by writing/singing or by playing them on a piano. Jazz musicians showed superior recall for aurally presented melodies when responding instrumentally (playing by ear), and their scores positively correlated with years of jazz experience. The authors concluded that extensive ear-playing and improvisation experience can enhance domain-specific working memory capacity – essentially, jazz training tunes the cognitive system to better handle musical information in real time. Furthermore, ear-trained musicians often develop efficient cognitive chunking strategies. Instead of processing every note in isolation, they rely on familiar patterns and harmonic sequences stored in long-term memory. When reproducing a melody by ear, skilled musicians may anticipate likely chord progressions or melodic resolutions based on their internalised musical grammar. This predictive listening reduces memory load by allowing the musician to generate expectations. Indeed, @woody2010 found that musicians with extensive vernacular (informal) music experience could learn melodies by ear with fewer repetitions than classically trained musicians, thanks in part to better anticipation of melodic/harmonic patterns. The ear-trained players applied a "more sophisticated knowledge base to generate accurate expectations" about how the melody would unfold. In contrast, formally trained players without strong ear-playing backgrounds used less efficient, more surface-level strategies for encoding melodies. This implies that cognitive schemas and pattern knowledge (acquired largely through listening and imitating) free up working memory resources during playing by ear by providing ready-made chunks and expectations. 

**Pitch Processing and Audiation:** A fundamental skill for playing by ear is precise pitch perception – the ability to identify and reproduce notes and intervals. Many ear players develop acute relative pitch skills, allowing them to recognise scale degrees or chord tones by ear and map them to their instrument. Some research has examined the role of absolute pitch in ear-playing as well. While absolute pitch (the rare ability to identify pitches without a reference) can aid certain tasks, most musicians rely on well-honed relative pitch and tonal schema to play by ear in real musical contexts. For instance, learning a song by ear often involves detecting its tonal center and scale, recognizing common chord progressions (e.g. the 12-bar blues or II–V–I progression in jazz), and using those frameworks to guide note choices. @Johansson2004, in a study of rock musicians, observed that ear players often identify familiar "clichés, harmonic formulas and other stylistic traits" of the genre to decode songs on the fly. In other words, they listen for characteristic chord patterns or melodic motifs, which helps them predict upcoming pitches. This genre-dependent pattern recognition underscores that ear-playing proficiency is partly a product of genre-specific listening experience. Musicians essentially build a library of musical phrases and progressions in memory by extensive listening; when a new piece is heard, they match it to known patterns. Over time, this process can become quite automatic. There is evidence that such auditory–tonal knowledge develops naturally with immersion: longitudinal studies of children [e.g., @mcphersonChildMusicianSkill2005] suggest that students who engage in informal music making (like picking out tunes by ear or jamming) often show improved ear-playing ability even without formal ear-training [@Varvarigou2014]. In summary, cognitive mechanisms of pitch processing in playing by ear involve both fine-grained perception (discriminating pitches and intervals) and higher-order schema (tonal and stylistic expectations), all coordinated through the musician’s auditory imagery and memory systems. 

**Sensorimotor Integration and Neural Basis**: Perhaps the most striking aspect of playing by ear is the seamless integration of heard sound with motor action. This audiomotor integration means that when an experienced musician hears a melody (externally or internally), their brain quickly maps those sounds to the required finger movements or vocal actions. Neuroscientific research has shed light on the brain networks that enable this feat. In skilled musicians, auditory and motor regions of the brain form strong bidirectional connections due to training. @novembreConceptualReviewActionperception2014 review evidence that musical training “couples” perception and action systems, such that perceiving a musical phrase can automatically activate the motor program to play it. This reflects the brain’s general action–perception coupling mechanism, where anticipated effects (like a heard note) can trigger the motor command associated with producing that effect. In the context of ear-playing, this means a violinist might hear a phrase in their mind and feel the impulse to execute the fingerings and bowings, or a pianist hearing a chord might internally rehearse the hand shape required. A vivid demonstration of advanced audiomotor integration is seen in jazz improvisers. @Harris2016 compared improvising pianists with classical score-dependent pianists in their ability to reproduce unfamiliar melodies by ear. They found that the improvising (ear-trained) musicians had a "superior ability… to replicate both the pitch and rhythm of aurally perceived music at the keyboard, not only in the original key, but also in other tonalities". In other words, those accustomed to playing by ear could accurately pick up a tune and immediately play it and even transpose it, far outperforming the note-bound players. The same study linked this behavioral skill to neural differences: an fMRI comparison revealed that improvising musicians showed enhanced activation in a right dorsal fronto-parietal network during audiation tasks, suggesting more efficient neural pathways for audiomotor transformations. These brain regions (including posterior parietal and premotor cortices) are thought to support mapping auditory inputs to motor responses. Likewise, @limbNeuralSubstratesSpontaneous2008's pioneering fMRI study of jazz improvisation found that spontaneous musical creation involves distinct neural dynamics (including heightened activity in motor-planning areas and the suppression of self-monitoring regions), illustrating the brain’s adaptation to real-time ear-to-hand performance. Collectively, such research underscores that playing by ear is a whole-brain activity: it recruits auditory perception circuits, memory and planning areas, and motor execution networks in a tightly coordinated loop. With training, this loop becomes highly optimised – as seen in professionals who can hear a melody once and immediately play it. Sensorimotor integration is thus at the core of playing by ear, enabling the immediate translation of heard musical ideas into played music.


### Developmental and Pedagogical Aspects of Playing By Ear Skill Acquisition

**Early Development and Informal Learning:** How do musicians acquire the ability to play by ear? Developmental studies indicate that playing by ear can emerge at surprisingly early stages given the right exposure. Many children first experience music informally – singing songs, copying melodies by ear on piano or guitar, improvising little tunes – often well before they read notation. Research by Gary McPherson [e.g., @mcphersonChildMusicianSkill2005; @mcphersonPathAnalysisTheoretical1997] followed young instrumental students over time and found that those who engaged in activities like singing or picking out tunes by ear showed enhanced musical understanding in the long run [@Varvarigou2014]. McPherson noted that having beginners “sing before playing” an instrument helps them internalise pitch and rhythm, which later aids in connecting sound to symbols (notation). In essence, early ear-playing experiences allow children to embody music – linking what they hear to what their fingers do – which lays a cognitive foundation for all subsequent musical learning. Another early study by @gerberInvestigationRelationshipPerformance1993 suggested that skill in playing by ear often develops naturally through unguided exploration: children who spend time noodling on their instrument, figuring out favorite tunes by ear, tend to improve in that ability through self-discovery. Such findings align with anecdotal observations that many talented ear-players are self-taught or began learning informally (e.g. picking up guitar chords from recordings or learning folk tunes by ear). In popular music contexts, it is common for beginners to start with imitation of recordings, gradually building a repertoire of songs by ear [@Green2002]. Overall, developmental evidence supports the idea that given exposure and opportunity, learners will cultivate ear-playing competencies even without formal instruction – though formal training can further refine and expand these skills. 

**Formal Pedagogy and Ear-Training:** Despite its evident benefits, playing by ear has not always been systematically incorporated into formal music education. Traditional Western pedagogy, especially in classical music, has heavily focused on notation literacy and technical exercises, with ear-playing sometimes regarded as a lesser skill or even a distraction. Nonetheless, a growing body of pedagogical research advocates for integrating playing by ear into teaching curricula for its positive impact on musicianship. @BakerGreen2013 conducted a landmark “Ear Playing Project” experiment with 10–14 year-old students in the UK, providing one group of students with regular opportunities to learn melodies by ear from recordings (instead of from notation) while a control group received only traditional instruction. After a period of instruction, all students were given standardised aural tests that required them to play back melodies and rhythms by ear. The results were striking: the ear-playing group surpassed the control group in every criterion (pitch accuracy, rhythmic accuracy, melodic contour, tempo, etc.) on the post-tests. In other words, those who practiced learning music by ear showed significantly greater improvement in aural skills than those who only learned through notation. This evidence strongly suggests that incorporating ear-playing in lessons can enhance students’ aural development. Notably, these gains did not come at the expense of other skills; instead, ear-playing experience appeared to reinforce musical memory and understanding that also benefit reading and performing. Parallel research by @muscoPlayingEarExpert2010 and @woody2012 addressed a common concern among music teachers that spending time on by-ear learning might impede music reading progress [@Varvarigou2014]. Their findings counter this worry: students can learn to play by ear and to read music in tandem, with each skill informing the other. In fact, @woody2012 argued that ear skills make students more sensitive and "musical" when reading notation, since they are not just decoding notes on the page but internally hearing and understanding them [@WoodysResearchAppear2018]. Recognizing these advantages, educational approaches like Suzuki method (for violin and other instruments) have long emphasised early ear training—students learn tunes by ear first, delaying notation, which purportedly develops strong listening and memory skills. Similarly, contemporary methods in popular music education (e.g., Lucy Green’s informal learning approach) deliberately use playing by ear in group teaching: students might be tasked with figuring out a pop song by listening to a recording together, fostering collaborative ear-learning. Teachers who have tried these approaches often report increased student engagement. For example, @Varvarigou2014 examined instrumental teachers’ experiences when they introduced “copying by ear” tasks in one-to-one lessons as part of the Ear Playing Project. Teachers adopted various strategies, such as singing or humming phrases to prompt students, asking guiding questions, and giving positive feedback while students learned songs by ear. By the end of the project, the teachers noted that incorporating ear-playing provided “a new and enjoyable way” to work on aural skills and even boosted their own confidence in teaching by ear. They observed that students seemed to enjoy lessons more, showed improved improvisation abilities, and grew more confident on their instruments through these activities. These qualitative outcomes echo formal test results: playing by ear can increase musical enjoyment and creativity, likely because it is a more naturally immersive way to learn music than reading alone. 

**Jazz Education and Professional Development:** To recap what was discussed in Chapter 3, in jazz, learning by ear has always been fundamental, and research on jazz pedagogy provides insights into advanced playing by ear skill development. For instance, jazz educators encourage students to transcribe solos by ear (i.e. learn them by listening and reproducing, sometimes writing them down afterward) and to learn tunes from recordings rather than fakebooks. This practice not only ingrains repertoire, but also develops the aural vocabulary needed for improvisation. Ethnographic work, such as Paul Berliner’s *Thinking in Jazz* -@berliner1994thinking, documents how jazz legends acquired their craft: virtually all spent countless hours listening to records, imitating phrasing and solos, and jamming informally – all ear-driven learning. Systematic studies reinforce this: for example, a study of collegiate jazz improvisers by @Norgaard2011 found that expert improvisers rely heavily on musical memory during performance. In interviews, professional jazz musicians described their improvisational thinking as a mix of prelearned phrases (licks) retrieved from memory, and spontaneous creation guided by ear. They reported that while improvising, they often recall well-learned ideas from memory and insert them, or choose notes based on an internal auditory priority (what they hear as the next phrase) rather than a purely theoretical formula. This again highlights the "primacy of the ear" (which is also the name given to the popular resource of the same name; @blakePrimacyEar2010): even at high expertise, what sounds right (shaped by extensive listening and internal audiation) directs the performance. The developmental implication is that advanced improvisational skill is built on a huge reservoir of learned-by-ear musical fragments and the ability to manipulate them in the moment. Consequently, jazz training at the professional level continues to emphasise ear training throughout a musician’s development. Many jazz programs include dedicated ear-training courses focused on recognizing chord progressions, melodies, and rhythms by ear. Beyond formal classes, mentorship in jazz often involves listening assignments and “call and response” imitation exercises in ensembles. All of these pedagogical practices reinforce the link between hearing and doing, which is at the heart of playing by ear. It is worth noting that not all learners find playing by ear equally intuitive – there are individual differences, and some may initially struggle with it if they have been exclusively notation-focused. However, pedagogues suggest that playing by ear can be nurtured in most students with patience. Starting with simple, familiar tunes (like folk songs) and having students figure them out by trial and error is a common approach. Students gradually learn to teach themselves music by ear, which is a powerful skill for lifelong learning. 

In summary, research in music education converges on the idea that integrating ear-playing experiences – whether through informal learning projects, ear-training exercises, or improvisational activities – significantly enriches musical development. It produces musicians who are more well-rounded, confident, creative, and able to adapt to new musical situations (a crucial trait for professionals). Ear-playing is no longer seen as mere talent or trick; it is increasingly recognised as a pedagogical tool and an objective of instruction in its own right.

### Practical Strategies and Individual Differences in Playing By Ear

**Learning Strategies for Playing by Ear:** Given the cognitive demands of playing by ear, musicians employ a variety of strategies to make the process efficient. One key strategy is chunking, as mentioned earlier – breaking the music into manageable units (whether melodic phrases, chord progressions, or rhythmic patterns). For instance, an ear-player might not think of a song as a sequence of 20 individual notes, but rather as a few melodic motifs and underlying chords. By identifying these chunks, the musician reduces what they have to remember and can more easily match what they play to what they heard. Another strategy is slow-down and repetition: many learners, including professionals, will loop difficult passages and slow them (a practice made easier with modern technology) to parse out details by ear. This is essentially applied analytical listening. Self-regulated learning plays a big role here – musicians often guide their own ear-learning process by setting small goals (e.g., “figure out just the bass line first” or “hum the melody before touching the instrument”), monitoring their accuracy, and adjusting their approach. Studies on practicing have found that skilled learners tend to audibly verify what they learned (e.g., singing a phrase to check it matches the original) and isolate trouble spots in their practice routines, which are hallmarks of self-regulation. While formal literature on self-regulated learning and ear-playing specifically is limited, we can draw parallels: effectively, when playing by ear, the musician is constantly assessing by listening – a feedback loop between output and the target sound. This builds not only the ear but also general problem-solving skills in music. Indeed, providing “opportunities for self-initiated learning and non-evaluated practice” – where students explore without immediate external correction – has been suggested as crucial for developing confidence in ear-playing [@Varvarigou2014]. Such unguided exploration allows individuals to discover what strategies work best for them, whether it’s trial-and-error, visualizing the music, or relying on muscle memory. 

**Improvisation and Creativity:** Improvisation is closely intertwined with playing by ear, as both involve real-time generation of music without reading. Many studies of improvisation emphasise the role of the ear: improvisers are essentially composing with their instrument in real time, and to do so, they must listen – to the accompanying music, to their own ideas as they unfold, and to an internal sense of where the music could go next. Psychological models of improvisation [ e.g., @JohnsonLaird2002; @Pressing1988] propose that improvisers use a repertoire of memorised licks plus generative rules to create new solos. The selection and execution of those licks is guided by auditory feedback: a player might hear a motif in their head and immediately play it, then listen to what they just played and let that spark the next idea. @Norgaard2011's study of expert jazz improvisers illustrated this iterative process of planning, executing, and monitoring during solos. The musicians described constantly evaluating their output ("was that phrase good? should I repeat it or change it?") and making adjustments on-the-fly. This improvisational thinking requires a well-trained ear to judge one’s musical statements and to hear possibilities before playing them. Because of this, exercises that strengthen playing by ear are often recommended to aspiring improvisers. For example, practicing call-and-response (where a teacher sings a phrase and the student plays it back) improves the ability to quickly translate heard ideas into played ideas – essentially building the reflexes needed for improvising. The role of individual learning styles also emerges here: some improvisers are more theory-oriented (they think in terms of scales, chord tones, and intellectual structures), whereas others are more aural (they rely on their ear and muscle memory of patterns). While both approaches can lead to effective improvisation, those with stronger aural skills often demonstrate more fluidity and originality, since they are not as constrained by theoretical rules in the moment but instead follow the sound they imagine. In any case, the consensus in jazz education is that a strong ear is indispensable for true improvisational freedom. 

**Formal vs. Informal Training and Individual Trajectories:** An important theme in playing by ear research is the contrast between formally trained musicians and those from informal backgrounds (such as self-taught popular musicians). Studies consistently show differences in how these groups learn and approach ear-playing. As discussed, @WoodyLehmann2010 found that college music students with vernacular (informal) experiences needed significantly fewer trials to learn melodies by ear than their strictly classically trained peers. The formally trained musicians often struggled initially because their habits were tied to written cues and deliberate practice of technique; they tended to focus on "physically producing the melodies" (e.g. thinking about finger positions) instead of listening to the melody as a whole. In contrast, the informal-trained students had automated much of the motor execution, allowing them to focus attention on the sound itself. This finding echoes many anecdotal observations in music teaching: students coming from church bands, garage bands, or other informal environments often have a natural ease with picking up songs by ear and playing with others, whereas conservatory-trained students might excel at reading and technique but initially feel "lost" without sheet music. Of course, these differences are not immutable – formal training can incorporate ear skills, and informal musicians can learn theory and reading. The point is that early experiences shape one’s musical orientation. Individual differences in auditory memory, motivation, and even personality (e.g. willingness to take risks) can also affect playing by ear ability. Some individuals seem to have a proclivity for learning by ear; researchers like @mishraRhythmicMelodicSight2016 have speculated about auditory working memory capacity or auditory imagery vividness as factors that might make one person a stronger ear-learner than another. However, the overarching message from the literature is that playing by ear is trainable. Even those who do not consider themselves naturally good at it can improve with practice and the right strategies. For instance, a case study by @Creech2008 showed that adult classical musicians, when encouraged to learn simple tunes by ear as part of a workshop, made substantial progress and reported it positively impacted their listening skills. Finally, a practical consideration is the use of technology in learning by ear. Modern tools (like slowing down apps, backing tracks, YouTube tutorials that teach by demonstration, etc.) have made ear-learning more accessible. While older generations might have lifted the record needle repeatedly to catch notes, today’s students can loop sections digitally. This doesn’t diminish the skill – it potentially accelerates it by providing clearer feedback. The core process remains: listening, decoding, and performing. But with or without technology, the research-backed strategies remain: sing the part (to ensure you really know how it should sound), break music into sections, use theory as a guide (e.g. recognizing “this passage outlines a D7 chord, so I expect these chord tones”), and most importantly, listen actively. As one educator summarised, "ear playing is learned by playing by ear" [@Johansson2004]
 – meaning the best way to get better is simply to do it, genre by genre, song by song, gradually building the mental library and reflexes that enable ever more fluent playing by ear.
 
 
### Playing by Ear Research: Conclusion

The phenomenon of playing by ear sits at the intersection of cognitive skill, pedagogical practice, and musical creativity. From a cognitive standpoint, playing by ear engages complex mental processes: vivid auditory imagery, specialised working memory, pattern recognition, and a tight coupling of perception and action. Neuroscience suggests that extensive ear-playing experience can even shape the brain, leading to more efficient audiomotor networks (as seen in improvising musicians). Developmentally, learning to play by ear can begin early and flourish in environments that encourage informal exploration. Incorporating ear-playing into formal instruction – as research in music education has shown – yields benefits for aural skills, musical understanding, and student motivation. In jazz and other professional domains, playing by ear is not only a skill to acquire but a mode of musical existence: it underpins the ability to improvise and to connect with music on a deeply intuitive level. Individual differences certainly influence how people approach playing by ear, yet studies underline that with the right strategies and experiences, virtually any musician can improve their ear-playing ability. This rich body of literature refutes the old notion that playing by ear is a mysterious gift; instead, it is a multifaceted skill set that can be analysed, taught, and learned. As @WoodysResearchAppear2018 observed, developing ear-based musicianship imbues music making with a certain "humanness"
 – it reconnects performers with the fundamentally aural nature of music. In practical terms, musicians who play by ear often learn new material faster, memorise more effectively, and perform with greater expressivity and flexibility. For educators, the implication is clear: fostering playing by ear alongside other skills produces more well-rounded and versatile musicians. For researchers, playing by ear remains a fertile topic, raising questions about auditory cognition, expert memory, and even cross-cultural musical learning. The literature so far, grounded in cognitive psychology, music psychology, and systematic musicology, provides a compelling case that playing by ear is both an essential subject of study and an invaluable aspect of musical praxis – from the novice learner picking out a tune, to the jazz virtuoso crafting a solo, guided all the while by the inner ear.
