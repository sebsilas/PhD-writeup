In this section, I provide an overview of the literature on playing by ear and related skills. Research specifically on the topic of "playing by ear" mainly comes from the music education and music performance literatures. I will review this literature first. However, this literature does not have a strong cognitive psychological depth. To build on this literature, therefore, I will turn more to the cognitive psychology literature. Here, "playing by ear" has not been established as a clear topic, though there is much related research. I will therefore synthesise these literatures and contextualise playing by ear specifically with a deeper cognitive psychological basis: that is, I will review the internal mechanisms that might underlie performance. This will prepare the next chapter, where I will propose a theorectical cognitive (and computational) model of playing by ear skills.

### Overview

#### Foundation or Frill? [@woody2012]


In music education research, in at least as early as the 1950's did researchers such as @mainwaring1951teaching begin advancing the importance of playing by ear skills in formal music education. By the late eighties, the music education literature began further lamenting that playing by ear skills were largely overlooked in music education, with the tyranny of visual notation being a main focus of teaching [@inbook; @priestPlayingEarIts1989]. A key emphasis and conclusion of this emerging literature in music education was that playing by ear skills were grossly overlooked, and actually turned out to be important contributors to musicianship as a whole: even sight reading skills [@mcphersonChildMusicianSkill2005].

#### From Sound to Sight rather than from Sight to Sound

As such, @inbook convey how musical meaning arises through a dynamic interplay between performer intention, listener interpretation, and cultural context, rather than being fixed in notation. They argued that music should be taught from sound to sign—that is, beginning with auditory and expressive engagement before introducing formal notation. This approach, they contend, better reflects how meaning is constructed in music and supports deeper, more intuitive learning. Their contribution is significant within music education and cognition, challenging notation-first traditions and advocating for a more experiential, communication-oriented model of instruction. Such an approach was later refined by @haston_playing_2022, who gave specific directives as to when learning visual notation should be (e.g., 6-7 years old, after many years of ear-only training).

#### The Contemporary Situation

Whilst visual notation may ostensibly reign supreme, perhaps in part due to the somewhat polemical literature reviewed that emerged arguing for the importance of playing by ear [@inbook; @muscoPlayingEarExpert2010; @priestPlayingEarIts1989], did attitudes and practices change. At the present time of writing, playing by ear seems to now be more widely recognised as a valuable pedagogical tool, with aural skill tests, including singing/playing by ear, being a feature of exam boards, at least in the UK. The development of playing-by-ear skills varies significantly across music examination boards. The *ABRSM* includes aural tests in which candidates sing back short melodies (Grades 1–3), but it does not assess instrumental playback by ear [@abrsm2024]. In contrast, the *Trinity College London* syllabus features a "musical recall" component that directly tests the ability to play by ear on an instrument [@trinity2024]. Similarly, *Rockschool* places strong emphasis on contemporary aural skills, including instrumental playback and improvisation as part of its exams from early grades [@rsl2024]. These differences reflect broader pedagogical focuses, with ABRSM favoring traditional classical training and Trinity and Rockschool supporting a more holistic or contemporary approach. Perhaps due to these contemporary picture, has there been a relative dearth of new research on playing by ear.

In the next section, I will describe findings from the music education and performance literature that help us understand the development of playing by ear skills and its relationship to other factors.

### Developmental and Pedagogical Aspects of Playing By Ear Skill Acquisition


How do musicians acquire the ability to play by ear? @muscoPlayingEarExpert2010's review reports that playing by ear skills may develop naturally over time [@gerberInvestigationRelationshipPerformance1993; @mcphersonChildMusicianSkill2005], through unsupervised practice [@mcphersonAssessmentMusicalPerformance1995] and practice with instruction [@bernhardEffectsTonalTraining2004; @brown1990investigation; @dickey1991comparison and are documented as being related to sight-reading [@luceSightreadingEarplayingAbilities1965; @mcphersonAssessmentMusicalPerformance1995; @mcphersonChildMusicianSkill2005]. Evidence suggests that the practice of recalling melodies on an instrument can improve playing by ear skills [@bernhard2005playing; @dickey1991comparison; @wilder1988investigation].


#### Early Development and Informal Learning 

Developmental studies indicate that playing by ear can emerge at surprisingly early stages given the right exposure. Many children first experience music informally – singing songs, copying melodies by ear on piano or guitar, improvising little tunes – often well before they read notation. Longitudinal research  [e.g., @mcphersonChildMusicianSkill2005; @mcphersonPathAnalysisTheoretical1997] followed young instrumental students over time and found that those who engaged in activities like singing or picking out tunes by ear showed enhanced musical understanding in the long run [@Varvarigou2014]. McPherson noted that having beginners "sing before playing" an instrument helps them internalise pitch and rhythm, which later aids in connecting sound to symbols (notation). In essence, early ear-playing experiences allow children to embody music – linking what they hear to what their fingers do – which lays a cognitive foundation for all subsequent musical learning. 

Another early study by @gerberInvestigationRelationshipPerformance1993 suggested that skill in playing by ear often develops naturally through unguided exploration: children who spend time noodling on their instrument, figuring out favorite tunes by ear, tend to improve in that ability through self-discovery. Such findings align with anecdotal observations that many talented ear-players are self-taught or began learning informally (e.g. picking up guitar chords from recordings or learning folk tunes by ear). In popular music contexts, it is common for beginners to start with imitation of recordings, gradually building a repertoire of songs by ear [@Green2002]. Overall, developmental evidence supports the idea that given exposure and opportunity, learners will cultivate ear-playing competencies even without formal instruction – though formal training can further refine and expand these skills. 

#### Formal Pedagogy and Ear-Training

Despite its evident benefits, playing by ear has not always been systematically incorporated into formal music education. Traditional Western pedagogy, especially in classical music, has heavily focused on notation literacy and technical exercises, with ear-playing sometimes regarded as a lesser skill or even a distraction. Nonetheless, a growing body of pedagogical research advocates for integrating playing by ear into teaching curricula for its positive impact on musicianship. @BakerGreen2013 conducted a landmark "Ear Playing Project" experiment with 10–14 year-old students in the UK, providing one group of students with regular opportunities to learn melodies by ear from recordings (instead of from notation) while a control group received only traditional instruction. After a period of instruction, all students were given standardised aural tests that required them to play back melodies and rhythms by ear. The results were striking: the ear-playing group surpassed the control group in every criterion (pitch accuracy, rhythmic accuracy, melodic contour, tempo, etc.) on the post-tests. In other words, those who practiced learning music by ear showed significantly greater improvement in aural skills than those who only learned through notation. This evidence strongly suggests that incorporating ear-playing in lessons can enhance students’ aural development. Notably, these gains did not come at the expense of other skills; instead, ear-playing experience appeared to reinforce musical memory and understanding that also benefit reading and performing. Parallel research by @muscoPlayingEarExpert2010 and @woody2012 addressed a common concern among music teachers that spending time on by-ear learning might impede music reading progress [@Varvarigou2014]. Their findings counter this worry: students can learn to play by ear and to read music in tandem, with each skill informing the other. In fact, @woody2012 argued that ear skills make students more sensitive and "musical" when reading notation, since they are not just decoding notes on the page but internally hearing and understanding them [@WoodysResearchAppear2018]. Recognising these advantages, educational approaches like Suzuki method (for violin and other instruments) have long emphasised early ear training—students learn tunes by ear first, delaying notation, which purportedly develops strong listening and memory skills [@hermannShinichiSuzukiMan1999]. Similarly, contemporary methods in popular music education (e.g., Lucy Green’s informal learning approach, @greenMusicInformalLearning2008) deliberately use playing by ear in group teaching: students might be tasked with figuring out a pop song by listening to a recording together, fostering collaborative ear-learning. Teachers who have tried these approaches often report increased student engagement. For example, @Varvarigou2014 examined instrumental teachers’ experiences when they introduced “copying by ear” tasks in one-to-one lessons as part of the *Ear Playing Project*. Teachers adopted various strategies, such as singing or humming phrases to prompt students, asking guiding questions, and giving positive feedback while students learned songs by ear. By the end of the project, the teachers noted that incorporating ear-playing provided "a new and enjoyable way" to work on aural skills and even boosted their own confidence in teaching by ear. They observed that students seemed to enjoy lessons more, showed improved improvisation abilities, and grew more confident on their instruments through these activities. These qualitative outcomes echo formal test results: playing by ear can increase musical enjoyment and creativity, likely because it is a more naturally immersive way to learn music than reading alone. 

#### Jazz Education and Professional Development

To summarise what was discussed in Chapter 3, in jazz, learning by ear has always been fundamental, and research on jazz pedagogy provides insights into advanced playing by ear skill development. For instance, jazz educators encourage students to transcribe solos by ear (i.e. learn them by listening and reproducing, sometimes writing them down afterward) and to learn tunes from recordings rather than fakebooks. This practice not only ingrains repertoire, but also develops the aural vocabulary needed for improvisation. Ethnographic work, such as Paul Berliner’s *Thinking in Jazz* -@berliner1994thinking, documents how jazz legends acquired their craft: virtually all spent countless hours listening to records, imitating phrasing and solos, and jamming informally – all ear-driven learning. Systematic studies reinforce this: for example, a study of collegiate jazz improvisers by @Norgaard2011 found that expert improvisers rely heavily on musical memory during performance. In interviews, professional jazz musicians described their improvisational thinking as a mix of pre-learned phrases (licks) retrieved from memory, and spontaneous creation guided by ear. They reported that while improvising, they often recall well-learned ideas from memory and insert them, or choose notes based on an internal auditory priority (what they hear as the next phrase) rather than a purely theoretical formula. This again highlights the "primacy of the ear" (also the name given to a popular resource of the same name; @blakePrimacyEar2010). Even at high expertise, what sounds right (shaped by extensive listening and internal audiation) directs the performance. The developmental implication is that advanced improvisational skill is built on a huge reservoir of learned-by-ear musical fragments and the ability to manipulate them in the moment. Consequently, jazz training at the professional level continues to emphasise ear training throughout a musician’s development. Many jazz programs include dedicated ear-training courses focused on recognizing chord progressions, melodies, and rhythms by ear. Beyond formal classes, mentorship in jazz often involves listening assignments and "call and response" imitation exercises in ensembles. All of these pedagogical practices reinforce the link between hearing and doing, which is at the heart of playing by ear.

#### Improvisation and Creativity

<!-- bring in some Pressing more here -->

Improvisation is closely intertwined with playing by ear, as both involve real-time generation of music without reading. Many studies of improvisation emphasise the role of the ear: improvisers are essentially composing with their instrument in real time, and to do so, they must listen – to the accompanying music, to their own ideas as they unfold, and to an internal sense of where the music could go next. Psychological models of improvisation [e.g., @JohnsonLaird2002; @Pressing1988] propose that improvisers use a repertoire of memorised licks plus generative rules to create new solos. The selection and execution of those licks is guided by auditory feedback: a player might hear a motif in their head and immediately play it, then listen to what they just played and let that spark the next idea. @Norgaard2011's study of expert jazz improvisers illustrated this iterative process of planning, executing, and monitoring during solos. The musicians described constantly evaluating their output ("was that phrase good? should I repeat it or change it?") and making adjustments on-the-fly. This improvisational thinking requires a well-trained ear to judge one’s musical statements and to hear possibilities before playing them. Because of this, exercises that strengthen playing by ear are often recommended to aspiring improvisers. For example, practicing call-and-response (where a teacher sings a phrase and the student plays it back) improves the ability to quickly translate heard ideas into played ideas – essentially building the reflexes needed for improvising. The role of individual learning styles also emerges here: some improvisers are more theory-oriented (they think in terms of scales, chord tones, and intellectual structures), whereas others are more aural (they rely on their ear and muscle memory of patterns). While both approaches can lead to effective improvisation, those with stronger aural skills often demonstrate more fluidity and originality, since they are not as constrained by theoretical rules in the moment but instead follow the sound they imagine. In any case, the consensus in jazz education is that a strong ear is indispensable for true improvisational freedom. 

A vivid demonstration of advanced audiomotor integration is seen in jazz improvisers. @Harris2016 compared improvising pianists with classical score-dependent pianists in their ability to reproduce unfamiliar melodies by ear. They found that the improvising (ear-trained) musicians had a "superior ability [...] to replicate both the pitch and rhythm of aurally perceived music at the keyboard, not only in the original key, but also in other tonalities". In other words, those accustomed to playing by ear could accurately pick up a tune and immediately play it and even transpose it, far outperforming the note-bound players. The same study linked this behavioral skill to neural differences: an *fMRI* comparison revealed that improvising musicians showed enhanced activation in a right dorsal fronto-parietal network during audiation tasks, suggesting more efficient neural pathways for audiomotor transformations. These brain regions (including posterior parietal and premotor cortices) are thought to support mapping auditory inputs to motor responses. Likewise, @limbNeuralSubstratesSpontaneous2008's pioneering *fMRI* study of jazz improvisation found that spontaneous musical creation involves distinct neural dynamics (including heightened activity in motor-planning areas and the suppression of self-monitoring regions), illustrating the brain's adaptation to real-time ear-to-hand performance. Collectively, such research underscores that playing by ear is a whole-brain activity: it recruits auditory perception circuits, memory and planning areas, and motor execution networks in a tightly coordinated loop. With training, this loop becomes highly optimised – as seen in professionals who can hear a melody once and immediately play it. Sensorimotor integration is thus at the core of playing by ear, enabling the immediate translation of heard musical ideas into played music.

In summary, research in music education converges on the idea that integrating ear-playing experiences – whether through informal learning projects, ear-training exercises, or improvisational activities – significantly enriches musical development. It produces musicians who are more well-rounded, confident, creative, and able to adapt to new musical situations (a crucial trait for professionals). Ear-playing is no longer seen as mere talent or trick; it is increasingly recognised as a pedagogical tool and an objective of instruction in its own right.


### McPherson's Integrated Model of Musical Skill Development

To situate playing by ear and its development among other skills in an integrative fashion, @mcpherson1993factors proposed and tested a theoretical model that examines the development of key musical performance skills among student instrumentalists. Drawing on both literature and empirical data—student performance outcomes and interviews, McPherson’s model offers a nuanced view of how various learning experiences and individual practices contribute to musicianship. The model, later supported by further analysis [@inbook], reveals both direct and indirect pathways between factors such as early musical experiences, quality and length of study, and the development of skills like sight-reading, improvisation, and playing by ear.

One of the central findings of McPherson’s model is the pivotal role of playing by ear. This skill was shown to be the strongest predictor of a student's ability to improvise, suggesting that aural engagement is foundational to more creative aspects of musical performance. Playing by ear was also shown to have a meaningful, though more complex, relationship with sight-reading ability—supporting earlier findings that ear-training may play a more critical role in developing musical fluency than traditionally emphasised [@luceSightreadingEarplayingAbilities1965; @priestPlayingEarIts1989]. If also found that early musical experiences positively influenced students' capacity to play by ear, though they had little impact on sight-reading. Similarly, engaging in enriching activities—such as improvising or playing by ear during practice—had a strong impact on the development of ear-playing skills, but again, less so on sight-reading. Interestingly, the quality of formal study had only a weak influence on both ear-playing and sight-reading, while the length of study had a moderate and consistent effect across multiple performance domains, including rehearsed performance, sight-reading, and playing by ear.

Through qualitative analysis of student interviews, McPherson also identified clear differences in cognitive strategy between less and more skilled performers. Less proficient players often relied on abstract, notation-based thinking, such as trying to identify note names while listening. In contrast, more capable musicians demonstrated a more integrated aural-kinesthetic approach, mentally translating what they heard directly into instrumental actions.

Overall, McPherson's model offers an argument for the centrality of ear-playing in music education, as further iterated in [@haston_playing_2022]. It suggests that developing the ability to play by ear not only supports improvisational skill but also facilitates the integration of aural, visual, and motor domains essential to fluent musicianship. These findings carry significant pedagogical implications, potentially challenging traditional hierarchies in music training and highlighting the potential value of emphasising aural-based learning strategies in instrumental instruction.

### Cognitive Mechanisms Underlying Playing by Ear


In this section, I now move towards thinking playing by ear at a more detailed cognitive level. As far as I am aware, no comprehensive cognitive model of playing by ear yet exists. However, several models come very close to describing this phenomenon, and I thus review them here.

In general, music performance relies on three key cognitive skills: goal imaging (imagining the sound), motor production (executing movements), and self-monitoring (hearing and assessing one’s performance) [@lehmann2002acquired; @woody2003explaining]. Similarly, @haston_playing_2022 describe playing by ear as requiring "aural discrimination skills and the alignment of concomitant motor skills: goal imaging, motor production, and self-monitoring. Linking that goal image to motor production is key.". Fluency in playing an instrument and by-ear playing involves creating strong connections between imagined sounds and physical actions—developing ear–hand coordination. Ideally, even reading music should trigger mental sounds that are already linked to specific instrumental actions.

In terms of cognition, I will review the various levels of processes required to play by ear, starting with "low-level" processes and moving up to high-level cognition.

#### Auditory Imagery and Mental Representation

A central cognitive component of playing by ear is *auditory imagery*: the ability to internally hear or imagine music without external sound [@geldingEfficientAdaptiveTest2021]. Skilled by-ear players exhibit strong auditory imagery capacities, which enable them to anticipate and mentally "hear" pitches and phrases before playing them. Behavioural evidence suggests that auditory imagery can guide performance by activating sensorimotor representations  [@novembreConceptualReviewActionperception2014a; @kellerAuditoryImageryShapes2010; @kellerPlanningExecutionShort2006; @pfordresherAuditoryFeedbackMusic2005; @pfordresherEffectsHearingPresent2006]. Imagining sounds that correspond to specific instrumental actions can trigger the motor programs for those actions. In other words, when an experienced musician internally hears a melody, that imagery is closely coupled with the fingerings or movements needed to produce it. This aligns with the concept of *audiation* in music education [@gordon2001; @gordonLearningSequencesMusic2007], whereby musicians "hear" music in their mind as a precursor to performing it. Neuroimaging evidence further supports this auditory–motor linkage. For example, studies show that simply imagining musical sequences engages regions of the brain’s motor planning network in trained musicians [@bangertSharedNetworksAuditory2006; @dausilioCrossmodalPlasticityMotor2006; @haueisenInvoluntaryMotorActivity2001; @novembreConceptualReviewActionperception2014a]. @kellerMentalImageryMusic2012 noted that mental imagery in music performance serves important functions such as planning upcoming notes and monitoring intonation. In the context of playing by ear, expert musicians form rich mental representations of pieces, often encoding not just the melodic contour but also harmonic and structural features. Research by @woody2020 demonstrated that musicians highly skilled in ear-playing use "harmonically oriented integrated cognitive strategies," whereas less experienced ear-players rely on more fragmentary, note-by-note approaches [@woody2020]. In Woody’s study, university music students who were guided to focus on a melody’s underlying chord progression developed a more substantive "goal image" of the tune, which in turn improved their ability to learn it by ear. This indicates that adding harmonic context to one’s auditory imagery (for instance, knowing the chord changes) leads to more robust mental representations and facilitates ear-playing. Thus, proficient playing by ear involves vivid auditory imagery and schema-like memory for musical patterns, especially harmonic frameworks.

#### Working Memory and Anticipation

Playing music by ear also engages working memory and long-term memory in unique ways. Musicians must temporarily hold incoming auditory information (i.e., the sounds just heard) while simultaneously planning and executing motor responses on their instrument. This places demands on the phonological loop (for retaining pitch sequences) as well as the integration of auditory and motor memory. Studies have explored how working memory for musical material might differ between those who rely on ear-playing and those who rely on notation. @Nichols2018 compared jazz and classically trained musicians on auditory working memory tasks and found notable differences. Jazz players – who typically emphasise learning by ear – outperformed classical players in remembering and reproducing heard melodies, especially when they had to play back the melodies on an instrument. In this study, musicians were asked to recall the final notes of sequences after a distraction, either by writing/singing or by playing them on a piano. Jazz musicians showed superior recall for aurally presented melodies when responding instrumentally (playing by ear), and their scores positively correlated with years of jazz experience. The authors concluded that jazz training (i.e., involving extensive ear-playing and improvisation experience) might enhance a domain-specific working memory capacity which allows the better handling of musical information in real time, especially relevant to improvised music contexts. Furthermore, ear-trained musicians often develop efficient cognitive chunking strategies. Instead of processing every note in isolation, they rely on familiar patterns and harmonic sequences stored in long-term memory. When reproducing a melody by ear, skilled musicians may anticipate likely chord progressions or melodic resolutions based on their internalised "musical grammar". This predictive listening reduces memory load by allowing the musician to generate expectations. In this way, @woody2010 found that musicians with extensive vernacular (informal) music experience could learn melodies by ear with fewer repetitions than classically trained musicians, thanks in part to better anticipation of melodic/harmonic patterns. The ear-trained players applied a "more sophisticated knowledge base to generate accurate expectations" about how a melody would unfold. In contrast, formally trained players without strong ear-playing backgrounds used less efficient, more surface-level strategies for encoding melodies. This implies that cognitive schemas and pattern knowledge (acquired largely through listening and imitating) free up working memory resources during playing by ear by providing ready-made chunks and expectations.

#### Pitch Processing and Audiation


playing by ear promotes "inner hearing" [@haston_playing_2022; @woody2012] - allows musicians to form a mental model of the sound they are going to play.

developing inner hearing allows performers to "listen with expectation" [@haston_playing_2022]

A fundamental skill for playing by ear is precise pitch perception – the ability to identify and reproduce notes and intervals. Many ear players develop acute relative pitch skills, allowing them to recognise scale degrees or chord tones by ear and map them to their instrument. Some research has examined the role of absolute pitch in ear-playing as well. While absolute pitch (the ability to identify pitches without a reference) can aid certain tasks, it appears to be somewhat rare, even in musician populations (< 30% with absolute pitch; @gregersenAbsolutePitchPrevalence1999; @leiteMusicProficiencyQuantification2016). Instead, most musicians seem to rely on well-honed relative pitch and tonal schema to play by ear in real musical contexts. For instance, learning a song by ear often involves detecting its tonal center and scale, recognizing common chord progressions (e.g. the 12-bar blues or II–V–I progression in jazz), and using those frameworks to guide note choices. @Johansson2004, in a study of rock musicians, observed that ear players often identify familiar "clichés, harmonic formulas and other stylistic traits" of the genre to decode songs on the fly. In other words, they listen for characteristic chord patterns or melodic motifs, which helps them predict upcoming pitches. This genre-dependent pattern recognition underscores that ear-playing proficiency is partly a product of genre-specific listening experience. Musicians essentially build a library of musical phrases and progressions in memory by extensive listening; when a new piece is heard, they match it to known patterns. Over time, this process can become quite automatic. In summary, cognitive mechanisms of pitch processing in playing by ear involve both fine-grained perception (discriminating pitches and intervals) and higher-order schema (tonal and stylistic expectations), all coordinated through the musician’s auditory imagery and memory systems. 


Playing by ear, sight-reading, and interacting musically help build an internal "aural database," expanding musicians' capacity to memorize more music [@fine2006music; @haston_playing_2022; @odam1995sound]

Aural imagery allows musicians to develop and store mental representations of melodic and harmonic patterns, which supports more efficient future learning [@freymuth1999mental]

Memorising music relies on integrating aural, visual, and kinesthetic codes, making learning more robust and multidimensional [@hallam1998predictors]

Playing by ear strengthens aural and kinesthetic memory - and possibly visual memory - as musicians often mentally visualise notation or musical structure [@woody2010; @woody2019psychology]


#### Sensorimotor Integration and Neural Basis

<!-- from Haston/Mcpherson: "Neuroimaging research shows similar brain activity when music is being heard and imagined, thus suggesting that a musician can "hear" correct pitches and "fel" correct muscular movements when practicing music mentally (Alluri, et al., 2017; Gordon, Cobb, & Balasubramaniam, 2018). This combina- tion ofhearing the note in combination with feeling how ti would beperformed on an ni- strument reminds us of the continual cross-modal processing that occurs in instrumental performance (Woody, 2012; Ross, 1985). Further research has shown that mental practice away from an instrument can be as productive asphysical practice (see Miksza, this part). " -->

Perhaps the most striking aspect of playing by ear is the seamless integration of heard sound with motor action. This audiomotor integration means that when an experienced musician hears a melody (externally or internally), their brain quickly maps those sounds to the required finger movements or vocal actions. Neuroscientific research has shed light on the brain networks that enable this feat. In skilled musicians, auditory and motor regions of the brain form strong bidirectional connections due to training. @novembreConceptualReviewActionperception2014a review evidence that musical training "couples" perception and action systems, such that perceiving a musical phrase can automatically activate the motor program to play it. This reflects the brain’s general action–perception coupling mechanism, where anticipated effects (like a heard note) can trigger the motor command associated with producing that effect. In the context of ear-playing, this means a violinist might hear a phrase in their mind and feel the impulse to execute the fingerings and bowings, or a pianist hearing a chord might internally rehearse the hand shape required. 


## Playing by Ear in Relation To Singing

@haston_playing_2022 argue that singing should be a frequent and integral component of early music instruction. To advance beyond singing alone, a connection between vocalisation and the corresponding instrumental fingerings should be established - in lieu of visual notation. The process of mentally and physically rehearsing a piece "by ear"—through simultaneous singing and fingering - would cultivate a child’s capacity to perceive sound through kinesthetic engagement, thereby promoting the integration of bodily movement with cognitive processes [@galvao1999kinaesthesia; @haston_playing_2022]. They further argue that application of solfège could further facilitate this transition by reinforcing the progression from rote memorisation (e.g., singing on a neutral syllable such as "la") to conceptual understanding (e.g., employing sol-fa syllables and correlating them with instrumental fingerings).


Musicians who both sing and play during the modeling or echo-teaching process strengthen the connection between their ears and fingers, promoting multimodal learning [@haston_playing_2022].


@WoodyLehmann2010 studied how well college music majors could learn melodies by ear. They compared students with “vernacular” music backgrounds (e.g., jazz, rock) to those trained mainly through formal instruction. The vernacular musicians outperformed the formal ones, needing fewer attempts to accurately sing or play back melodies. On average, vernacular students required 3 attempts to sing and 3.8 to play melodies, compared to 6.4 and 10.6 for formal students, suggesting that vernacular training places emphasis on both melodic memory (goal imaging) and the ability to reproduce melodies on instruments (motor production).


## Pfordresher's H-PAC Model

## Pfordresher's Cognitive Model of Singing Accuracy

I start first by using @pfordresherTheoreticalPerspectivesSinging2015's cognitive (but non-computational) model of singing accuracy, which is the most broad of the models I will review. At the low level, this model comprises an auditory feedback loop. In this loop, first, external auditory input is processed as low-level perceptual representations of sound (pitch, duration, timbre, loudness). Such low-level representations are used as input to a translation model, which relates auditory input to sensorimotor action that is relevant to singing. Hence, this enables the guidance of a singer’s sensorimotor plans to adjust their singing (e.g., to be in tune), in response to auditory feedback. Such changes in sensorimotor actions comprise physical processes like respiration, phonation, and articulation. Abstracting the sensorimotor part to the domain of playing by ear, such physical processes would be somewhat instrument-specific. For many instruments, the physical part will involve finger coordination (e.g., clarinet, violin), but for some, coordination will be more at the level of the arm  (e.g., percussion, drums). Many processes will be instrument-specific processes. For example, for brass and woodwind instruments, requiring to coordinate an embouchure to produce a sound. We do not exhaust these instrument-specific processes, but only state that such physical processes are part of the model, with instrument-specific attributes.

The lower-level auditory representations are also used as input to higher levels of cognition, which hold mental templates about music (e.g., its features, such as its tonality), stored in long- term memory (Baddeley et al., 2009). These templates allow auditory content to be categorized, forming more sophisticated representations of it, taking on musical domains such as representations of (melodic) features like tonality and contour, as well as segmenting melodies into coherent perceptual chunks. These formed higher-level representations can in turn be used as input back to the lower-level auditory feedback loop and further inform sensorimotor planning. Hence, the overall architecture of Pfordresher et al. (2015)’s cognitive model is bidirectional: both "top down" and "bottom up". Altogether, this system enables a singer - to fulfill objectives related to sung recall (i.e., hearing stimuli, representing its musical features mentally, responding through singing, and adjusting behavior to fulfill the goal sufficiently). This can readily be abstracted to playing by ear too: the only difference being in the motor plan aspects, which, as mentioned, are instrument-specific. Our focus in the current manuscript is on the higher-level aspects of this model: memory for melodic representations.

## Baker's Computational Model of Melodic Dictation


## Models of Sung Recall

Lastly, I synthesise models from my own research regarding sung melodic recall. My @silasSingingAbilityAssessment2023 study investigated sung recall by examining its relationship with other related skills and participant attributes. Demographically, better sung recall ability ability was associated with more musical training (𝛽 = 0.07), a younger age (𝛽 = -0.05), and being female (𝛽 = -0.03), though the latter two effects were small. The findings suggest that while musical training can enhance singing ability, inherent skills might also predispose individuals to seek musical training. Moreover, there was a relatively large difference between the marginal and conditional R^2 values, which suggests that there is a sizeable proportion of individual differences in the sample of participants tested which explains SAA performance which shows that individual differences should explain performance on a task in which one can develop high levels of domain-specific expertise.

We found there that melodic discrimination, pitch imagery abilities, and mistuning perception appear to be fundamental skills contributing to melodic sung recall. The sung recall score we devised moderately correlated with self-reported singing ability (r = .46) and musical training (r = ?). However, it shows no significant correlation with visuospatial working memory or pitch discrimination, aligning with previous research and suggesting that singing ability is not closely linked to low-level perceptual processes. This suggests that, whilst 

The study also shows that melodic features which indicate melodic complexity (including melody length) are relevant predictors of sung recall performance. These predictors represented melody length, as well as features related to contour, tonality, statistical occurrence of N-grams in the melody, and durational complexity. Rhythmic trials were generally found to be more difficult (B = -0.15, p < .001) and we found that it was appropriate to create separate models for arhythmic and rhythmic.

In another of my papers, [@silasLearningRecallingMelodies2023], we investigated how individuals learn and recall melodies using a computational approach that emphasizes similarity metrics rather than traditional accuracy-based methods. The research involved 31 participants who sang back 28 melodies presented either as piano sounds or vocal audio excerpts from pop songs, with each melody repeated up to six times. The similarity between the target melody and the participants' sung recalls was measured using advanced algorithmic techniques. The primary goal was to understand how melodic recall improves over successive attempts and what factors most significantly influence recall accuracy.

One of the key findings of the study is that the length of sung recall attempts consistently increases across multiple attempts, and this increase significantly correlates with the overall similarity to the target melody. This observation challenges the traditional view that musical features such as interval patterns or tonality are the primary factors influencing melodic recall. Instead, the study suggests that the sheer length of the melody plays a more critical role, indicating that general memory constraints may be more influential than music-specific features. This insight aligns with theories of working memory, suggesting that melodic recall shares characteristics with other types of serial recall rather than being purely domain-specific to music.

A significant finding (presented there in Figure 8), examines how similarity changes as a function of attempt and the specific section of the melody (beginning, middle, end). The results show that similarity performance increases more rapidly for the beginning of the melody compared to the middle and end across successive attempts. This indicates that participants tend to stabilise their recall of the initial melodic segments earlier than the middle or end sections. The end sections, in particular, show a slower rate of improvement, suggesting that the latter parts of a melody are more challenging to accurately recall perhaps due to the higher working memory load as a result of having to remember more notes, the later you are in a position, or that generally people engaging in sung recall prioritise getting the earlier parts melody correct first.  This finding supports the theory that memory encoding is stronger for the beginning of sequences, a phenomenon consistent with the primacy effect observed in other types of serial recall tasks. It also highlights that recall accuracy is not uniformly distributed across a melody, with the initial segments being more robustly learned compared to later ones.

The study also found that musical training did not significantly enhance recall performance when similarity metrics were used as the primary assessment method, as shown in another key result. This challenges the conventional belief that formal musical training substantially improves melodic recall ability. Instead, the data suggests that domain-general memory skills may be just as important, pointing to a more integrative understanding of how musical and non-musical cognitive processes interact.

Moreover, the results highlight that similarity scores increase with each successive attempt, but the rate of improvement diminishes after the third or fourth attempt. This pattern suggests that the most substantial gains in melodic recall occur early in the learning process, followed by incremental refinements in pitch and rhythm accuracy. Additionally, melodies presented as vocal audio excerpts resulted in higher recall accuracy compared to piano sound presentations, indicating that the human voice might provide additional mnemonic cues that aid in memory encoding.

Overall, the study's use of similarity-based metrics, particularly the "opti3" metric that integrates pitch intervals, harmonic progression, and rhythmic similarity, offers a more nuanced and accurate assessment of how melodies are learned and recalled. By focusing on the gradual increase in recall length and the differential improvement across melodic segments, the study sheds light on the underlying cognitive processes involved in melodic memory, emphasizing the role of general memory mechanisms and the relatively limited impact of formal musical training.

 
### Playing by Ear Research: Conclusion

The phenomenon of playing by ear sits at the intersection of cognitive skill, pedagogical practice, and musical creativity. From a cognitive standpoint, playing by ear engages complex mental processes: vivid auditory imagery, specialised working memory, pattern recognition, and a tight coupling of perception and action. Neuroscience suggests that extensive ear-playing experience can even shape the brain, leading to more efficient audiomotor networks (as seen in improvising musicians). Developmentally, learning to play by ear can begin early and flourish in environments that encourage informal exploration. Incorporating ear-playing into formal instruction – as research in music education has shown – yields benefits for aural skills, musical understanding, and student motivation. In jazz and other professional domains, playing by ear is not only a skill to acquire but a mode of musical existence: it underpins the ability to improvise and to connect with music on a deeply intuitive level. Individual differences certainly influence how people approach playing by ear, yet studies underline that with the right strategies and experiences, virtually any musician can improve their ear-playing ability. This rich body of literature refutes the old notion that playing by ear is a mysterious gift; instead, it is a multifaceted skill set that can be analysed, taught, and learned. As @WoodysResearchAppear2018 observed, developing ear-based musicianship imbues music making with a certain "humanness"
 – it reconnects performers with the fundamentally aural nature of music. In practical terms, musicians who play by ear often learn new material faster, memorise more effectively, and perform with greater expressivity and flexibility. For educators, the implication is clear: fostering playing by ear alongside other skills produces more well-rounded and versatile musicians. For researchers, playing by ear remains a fertile topic, raising questions about auditory cognition, expert memory, and even cross-cultural musical learning. The literature so far, grounded in cognitive psychology, music psychology, and systematic musicology, provides a compelling case that playing by ear is both an essential subject of study and an invaluable aspect of musical praxis – from the novice learner picking out a tune, to the jazz virtuoso crafting a solo, guided all the while by the inner ear.

### Practical Strategies and Individual Differences in Playing By Ear






#### Learning Strategies for Playing by Ear

Modelling i.e., call and response is an effective method to teach playing by ear skills [@dickey1988comparison; @haston_playing_2022; @hastonBeginningWindInstrument2010]

Given the cognitive demands of playing by ear, musicians employ a variety of strategies to make the process efficient. One key strategy is chunking, as mentioned earlier – breaking the music into manageable units (whether melodic phrases, chord progressions, or rhythmic patterns). For instance, a by-ear player might not think of a song as a sequence of 20 individual notes, but rather as a few melodic motifs and underlying chords. By identifying these chunks, the musician reduces what they have to remember and can more easily match what they play to what they heard. 

Another strategy is slow-down and repetition: many learners, including professionals, will loop difficult passages and slow them (a practice made easier with modern technology) to parse out details by ear. This is essentially applied analytical listening. Self-regulated learning plays a big role here – musicians often guide their own ear-learning process by setting small goals (e.g., "figure out just the bass line first" or "hum the melody before touching the instrument"), monitoring their accuracy, and adjusting their approach. Studies on practicing have found that skilled learners tend to audibly verify what they learned (e.g., singing a phrase to check it matches the original) and isolate trouble spots in their practice routines, which are hallmarks of self-regulation. While formal literature on self-regulated learning and ear-playing specifically is limited, we can draw parallels: effectively, when playing by ear, the musician is constantly assessing by listening – a feedback loop between output and the target sound. This builds not only the ear but also general problem-solving skills in music. Indeed, providing "opportunities for self-initiated learning and non-evaluated practice" – where students explore without immediate external correction – has been suggested as crucial for developing confidence in ear-playing [@Varvarigou2014]. Such unguided exploration allows individuals to discover what strategies work best for them, whether it’s trial-and-error, visualising the music, or relying on muscle memory. 


#### Formal vs. Informal Training and Individual Trajectories


An important theme in playing by ear research is the contrast between formally trained musicians and those from informal backgrounds (such as self-taught popular musicians). Studies consistently show differences in how these groups learn and approach ear-playing. As discussed, @WoodyLehmann2010 found that college music students with vernacular (informal) experiences needed significantly fewer trials to learn melodies by ear than their strictly classically trained peers. The formally trained musicians often struggled initially because their habits were tied to written cues and deliberate practice of technique; they tended to focus on "physically producing the melodies" (e.g. thinking about finger positions) instead of listening to the melody as a whole. In contrast, the informal-trained students had automated much of the motor execution, allowing them to focus attention on the sound itself. This finding echoes many anecdotal observations in music teaching: students coming from church bands, garage bands, or other informal environments often have a natural ease with picking up songs by ear and playing with others, whereas conservatory-trained students might excel at reading and technique but initially feel "lost" without sheet music. Of course, these differences are not immutable – formal training can incorporate ear skills, and informal musicians can learn theory and reading. The point is that early experiences shape one's musical orientation. Individual differences in auditory memory, motivation, and even personality (e.g. willingness to take risks) can also affect playing by ear ability. Some individuals seem to have a proclivity for learning by ear; researchers like @mishraRhythmicMelodicSight2016 have speculated about auditory working memory capacity or auditory imagery vividness as factors that might make one person a stronger ear-learner than another. However, the overarching message from the literature is that playing by ear is trainable. Even those who do not consider themselves naturally good at it can improve with practice and the right strategies. For instance, a case study by @Creech2008 showed that adult classical musicians, when encouraged to learn simple tunes by ear as part of a workshop, made substantial progress and reported it positively impacted their listening skills. Finally, a practical consideration is the use of technology in learning by ear. Modern tools (like slowing down apps, backing tracks, YouTube tutorials that teach by demonstration, etc.) have made ear-learning more accessible. While older generations might have lifted the record needle repeatedly to catch notes, today’s students can loop sections digitally. This doesn’t diminish the skill – it potentially accelerates it by providing clearer feedback. The core process remains: listening, decoding, and performing. But with or without technology, the research-backed strategies remain: sing the part (to ensure you really know how it should sound), break music into sections, use theory as a guide (e.g. recognizing “this passage outlines a D7 chord, so I expect these chord tones”), and most importantly, listen actively. As one educator summarised, "ear playing is learned by playing by ear" [@Johansson2004] – meaning the best way to get better is simply to do it, genre by genre, song by song, gradually building the mental library and reflexes that enable ever more fluent playing by ear.
