Jazz is an oral tradition. Cognitive psychological tool If you want to learn the tradition, transcribe the solos, go and play with new solos. Less a means of learning the tradition orally (best go straight to the source, transcribe real solos) - more about developing personal vocabulary based on your current knowledge.

At the heart of this ability lies a complex set of cognitive, perceptual, and motor processes that transform a heard melody into a performed one, without reliance on written notation. While musicians have long developed this skill through immersion and repetition, this project asks: can we systematise and support this learning process through adaptive, computer-assisted methods? The central problem addressed here is how to select and deliver the most useful melodic material for learners to practise at any given time. More concretely, how can we build a system that responds to individual learning needs—tracking what a musician finds easy or difficult, what they are likely to forget, and what would help them progress? Instead of relying on fixed curricula or static pattern books, this research explores the potential of computational models to make such decisions in a dynamic, data-driven way, whilst also shedding light on the cognitive processes underpinning playing by ear abilities. The proposed solution adopts a practical approach: rather than solely relying on a fixed theory of musical difficulty or melodic structure, the system is designed to learn from new data—specifically, from how real learners interact with musical material. This reflects a broader empiricist tradition in music cognition and psychology, where the goal is to observe patterns and build models based on actual behaviour. Drawing from psychometric frameworks like item response theory to model what musical features make certain melodies easier or harder to play by ear and synthesising this with models of learning trajectories inspired by broader cognitive psychology, information is leveraged to tailor learning for each user. In contrast to more abstract approaches, this project is grounded in musical practice. The models are trained not on idealised musical forms but on melodies more likely to be used by real learners—such as transcribed jazz solos or pedagogical patterns from exercise books. The system is built with a strong focus on usability and feedback, aiming to be both a research tool and a practical aid for musicians. Lastly, as the title suggests, a “computational” approach is taken to tackle this question. In general, this refers to using computational methods to solve problem. But it also has the more specific meaning in cognitive science - to describe methods and models in a sufficiently precise way that someone else could reproduce it. Ultimately, this research brings together insights from music education, music psychology, cognitive science, and computer-assisted learning. It uses these to ask both empirical and applied questions, such as: What makes a melody hard to reproduce by ear - or learn to reproduce by ear? How does the mode of learning (by sight or sound) affect retention and performance? And how can we use this knowledge to build better learning environments for contemporary musicians? 3.2 Motivations Learning to play melodies by ear is often described as an essential musicianship skill (CITE) because it touches almost every domain of music-making: improvisation, memory, listening, interpretation, and expression. Despite its importance, however, playing by ear remains poorly understood in terms of the specific processes involved, and it is still largely taught through informal or experience-based methods. This project is motivated by a desire to bring clarity, structure, and modern learning tools to a domain that has traditionally relied on tacit knowledge. At the same time, we live in a moment where computational tools have become central to how we study music. Musicologists, psychologists, and educators alike are increasingly turning to data-driven approaches to understand how musical knowledge is formed, transmitted, and used. This project aligns with that shift. It explores how methods from psychometrics and computational learning can help unpack what’s happening when someone learns to play a melody by ear—and how we might support that learning more effectively. From a cognitive science perspective, playing by ear is a fascinating - and sophisticated - domain to study. It requires the integration of auditory perception, short- and long-term memory, motor control, and pattern recognition, all operating in a feedback loop (CITE PFORDRESHER). The ability to take a heard melody, internalise its structure, and translate it into action on an instrument is not only musically rich—it’s cognitively complex. Understanding this process gives us insights into broader questions about how musicians represent, store, and retrieve musical information. From a computational standpoint, the project draws inspiration from language learning technologies that personalise the delivery of vocabulary items to match the learner’s memory and skill state. Melodies, like words, can be seen as structured sequences with varying complexity, familiarity, and usefulness. This opens the door to modelling musical learning in ways that are already well-established in educational psychology but have rarely been less often applied to music. Finally, this work is motivated by a practical and pedagogical concern: many musicians—especially those in jazz and oral traditions—struggle to find tools that support their aural learning processes which are based on robust scientific principles. Existing “ear training” apps tend to focus on recognition rather than production, and they often lack adaptivity, theoretical grounding, or openness for academic use. This project aims to fill that gap by building an open-source system that is not only informed by theory but is also flexible, responsive, and grounded in real musical materials. In short, the motivation for this research lies at the intersection of four fields: cognitive psychology, systematic musicology, computational modelling, and educational practice. It is driven by both theoretical questions about how we learn music and practical concerns about how we can learn it better. The two main problems this thesis attempts to solve is: A Computational Model of Playing By Ear Abilities: Given an aurally presented melody as input and a reproduction of that melody by a performer as output, what are the cognitive processes underlying performance? Can input characteristics about a given performer and the melody to be performed predict subsequent output accurately? This problem is one of developing a) a cognitive, computational model of playing by ear skills. Extending such a model, how do b) people learn to play by ear? Based on such knowledge, how can people learn to play by ear more effectively? Selecting melodic material for people to effectively enhance their playing by ear skills: Based on the computational model devised above, the second problem is that of selecting new melodic material to learn to improve playing by ear skills. How can we curate melodic material, select from it, and potentially generate new optimum material for learners to enhance their playing by ear skills more effectively than the use of manual methods alone. 3.2.1 Generalising beyond jazz and playing by ear Whilst this thesis is initially motivated historically and pedagogically in terms of jazz education, it is assumed that many of the outcomes will be relevant to the playing by ear of melodies in general. In other words, it assumed that, whilst there will be domain-specific findings, much of the work should shed light on the cognitive processes underlying melodic memory and learning in general. In this way, much of the approach and findings should logically extend to the realm of singing (by ear) too, which is far more ubiquitous. Since virtually everyone can sing (CITE) but far fewer people have access to an instrument beyond the voice (CITE), I will often discuss singing by ear and borrow from this literature. In general, much of the cognitive processes behind singing and playing by ear should be very similar. I thus suggest that the outcomes of this dissertation are not only relevant to jazz musicians, but can have a much larger impact, for musicians and musics of all kinds - at least in principle. In practice, model specifics may need adapting for utmost relevance to other domains. 3.3 Thesis Statement The thesis proposed in this dissertation is that computer-assisted learning systems—designed in alignment with cognitive psychology, psychometric modelling, and computational music analysis—can substantially improve the acquisition of melodic playing by ear skills in music learners. This research is grounded in the belief that automated, adaptive systems informed by statistical and psychological principles can serve as effective tools for developing musicianship skills that traditionally rely on subjective teaching and rote learning. Specifically, the present research investigates the following key questions: What psychometric and computational features of melodic stimuli best predict difficulty in playing by ear tasks? How can a computerised adaptive system deliver melodies in a way that maximally supports durable learning and personalised progression? What are the empirical effects of such a system compared to traditional, non-adaptive methods for learning melodies? To answer these questions, the research adopts a multi-part approach involving the development of new psychometrically valid tests, statistical modelling of melodic corpora, and the design and evaluation of an adaptive training system. The methodologies draw on the fields of music psychology, psychometrics and statistical modelling/machine learning and the system is developed using open-source technologies to ensure accessibility and reproducibility. This research also leverages insights from language learning and item response theory to address the cognitive dimensions of musical learning and proposes novel mechanisms for real-time assessment and personalised item delivery. 3.4 Original Contributions This dissertation makes several original contributions across the domains of music psychology, psychometrics, computational music analysis, and music education technology. Development of an Automated Playing by Ear Test A key contribution is the creation of a fully automated, computer-scored playing by ear ability test. Unlike previous assessments, this test allows for real-time behavioural scoring, enabling scalable and objective evaluation of melodic ear-to-hand coordination. This test lays the empirical foundation for later adaptive training applications and contributes a novel psychometric tool for music research and education. Psychometric Modelling of Melodic Item Difficulty Through item response theory and explanatory modelling, this research identifies and quantifies the features (e.g., tonality, melodic contour, interval structure) that make melodic items more or less difficult for learners. These findings enhance theoretical understanding of melodic cognition and provide empirical guidelines for designing effective learning materials. Creation of an Adaptive Training System for Melodic Learning The dissertation proposes and implements an adaptive computer-assisted learning (CAL) system that dynamically selects and delivers melodic stimuli based on real-time learner performance. By incorporating spaced repetition and similarity-based item delivery algorithms, the system optimises both the efficiency and longevity of learning. Digitisation and Optimisation of Melodic Corpora This research includes the development of software tools (e.g., itembankr, musicassessr) that process and structure melodic corpora (e.g., jazz transcriptions, pedagogical pattern books) into statistically characterisable item banks. This facilitates both learning and research, enabling a data-driven approach to musical skill acquisition. Empirical Evaluation through Controlled Interventions The final component of the project involves a controlled intervention study that compares the adaptive CAL system against traditional learning methods. The study evaluates long-term retention, learning efficiency, and user satisfaction, offering concrete evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed system. Together, these contributions represent a significant advancement in how musical skills—particularly those related to improvisation and aural learning—can be taught and understood through technology. The research also delivers openly available software and data, providing a platform for future studies and educational applications. 3.5 Research Questions At its core, this dissertation seeks to answer the primary question: PRQ1: How can one effectively learn to play by ear (PBE)? This is explored through four intersecting lenses—psychological, musicological, computational, and pedagogical—each of which shapes how the skill of playing by ear can be understood, modelled, and improved. To address this overarching problem, several more specific research questions are posed: SRQ1: What makes playing by ear difficult? (Exploring psychological and music-theoretical factors such as memory, melodic complexity, and contour.) SRQ2: Can a computer application that dynamically selects practice material help learners improve faster? (Assessing the role of computational adaptivity in musical skill acquisition.) SRQ3: What needs to be taken into account by such a model of adaptive learning? (Investigating features like difficulty, adaptivity, spacing, and history—the DASH model—as key inputs.) SRQ4: Does the mode of presentation (visual notation vs. auditory listening) influence how well a melody is learned? (Examining modality effects on encoding, retention, and recall.) SRQ5: Does singing a melody before playing it aid the learning process? (Exploring embodied cognition and internal audiation as pedagogical tools.) SRQ6: To what extent is PBE driven by absolute pitch abilities versus relative pitch strategies? SRQ7: What is the relationship between general cognitive capacities—like working memory—and PBE, and how do they interact with musical training? In addition, the project explores the connection between sight-reading and PBE skills, asking whether the two are complementary, independent, or perhaps grounded in shared underlying mechanisms. A second overarching question guides the later stages of the project: PRQ2: Can an intervention—specifically, an adaptive, computational learning system—lead to measurable improvements in PBE performance? This question shifts from theory to application, testing whether a system built on the insights above actually works in practice. The broader aim is not only to build such a system but also to evaluate its effectiveness in real learning contexts through controlled experimental studies. Finally, the project engages with what might be called the “Coltrane-Slonimsky Problem”: Given a vast landscape of melodic material, how can one select items that are both suitably challenging and musically engaging for the learner? Solving this requires balancing psychological difficulty with artistic relevance—a challenge that lies at the intersection of computation and musicianship. 3.6 Objectives and Scope In response to the research questions above, the dissertation pursues the following concrete objectives: To empirically examine what makes melodies difficult to learn by ear, using item response theory and performance data to model melodic difficulty based on psychological and structural features. To develop and validate a computerised PBE ability test, capable of recording, scoring, and tracking melodic performance in real time, forming the foundation for adaptive learning. To design and implement an adaptive learning system—the Songbird platform—that delivers personalised melodic training based on individual user profiles, learning history, and cognitive principles. To digitise, analyse, and optimise melodic corpora from both real jazz transcriptions and pedagogical pattern books—converting them into structured item banks for learning (slonimsky.app). To investigate pedagogical strategies, including the impact of presentation modality (visual vs. auditory) and the use of singing as a preparatory step in melodic reproduction. To run an interventional study evaluating the system’s effectiveness, measuring whether the adaptive system leads to improved learning outcomes compared to traditional or non-adaptive methods. To make all tools and datasets freely available as open-source software, supporting further research and application in music cognition, education, and human-computer interaction. 3.6.1 Scope The scope of this research is intentionally delimited in several ways: Musical focus: The primary context is jazz and related genres where playing by ear is central. However, the underlying cognitive and computational models may generalise to other traditions. Task type: The project focuses specifically on melodic ear-to-hand coordination—reproducing heard melodies on an instrument without notation—rather than broader definitions of improvisation or harmonic ear training. User level: While designed with advanced students and self-directed learners in mind, the systems developed may also support novices or be used in classroom settings as a pedagogical supplement. Musical representation: Melodies are treated symbolically as discrete event sequences (pitches, intervals), allowing for clean computational modelling. Audio processing is not the focus, though real-world audio is considered in some experiments. Methodological scope: The project blends controlled experiments, computational modelling, and tool development. It does not aim to exhaustively model all aspects of musical improvisation or ear training but rather to provide a focused and rigorous foundation for future research. 3.7 Front-Facing Tools 3.7.1 Slonimsky.app Slonimsky.app is a digital interface and training tool aimed at advanced learners, particularly within jazz and improvisation-rich traditions. Named in homage to Nicolas Slonimsky’s Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns, this application converts melodic content from jazz solos, pattern books, and pedagogical sources into a searchable, adaptive item bank. The goal is to solve the “Coltrane-Slonimsky Problem”: given a wide field of musical possibilities, how can we find the next melody that’s optimally challenging and musically rewarding? Slonimsky.app incorporates models of difficulty and melodic similarity, allowing learners to explore and practice material personalised to their evolving skill level. It supports improvisers and ear-trained musicians in expanding their vocabulary in a structured yet musically sensitive way. 3.7.2 Songbird Songbird (songbird.training) is designed as a psychometrically informed tool to support the development of singing and melodic memory in younger learners and educational settings. It provides a streamlined, browser-based interface that presents melodic stimuli, records vocal reproductions, and assesses performance in real time. Built to function both as a research platform and educational tool, Songbird tracks individual progress and adapts the difficulty of stimuli over time. It also includes pedagogical modules that integrate singing as a foundational step in melodic learning—supporting the hypothesis that vocal practice aids both memory and instrumental imitation. It is particularly well-suited for use in schools, choirs, and youth music programmes. 3.8 Dissertation Outline First, I will motivate my discussion of learning to play by ear with some historical context around the traditional methods that have been used, particularly with in the context of learning to play jazz music in the 20th and then 21st century. Then, I will largely leave this historical context behind and motivate the question from systematic musicological and cognitive psychological points of view, where the remainder of this manuscript will largely remain. As discussed, there are two (related) principal problems that this thesis aims to tackle. First, since, as of yet, there exists no comprehensive computational model of playing by ear skills (in terms of both acquisition and utilisation), I intend to first propose a theoretical model based on a synthesis of related literature. Once described, I seek to investigate and validate parts of this proposed model in light of empirical data. The second principal problem is to, given such a computational model, design a computer application which helps playing by ear learners more efficiently improve their skills. This part of the thesis has a practical deliverable component that is intended to be used in real-life learning situations, whilst being situated in a scientific framework - both theoretical and statistical. Such an application would be proposed in an open source framework that can be extended by future developers to add new features and improve existing components of the application. The main problem the application intends to solve is one of item selection i.e., finding “optimum” playing by ear items to learn for a given learner, at a given timepoint. "],["foundations.html", "4 Foundations 4.1 What is playing by ear? 4.2 Learning to play by ear", " 4 Foundations 4.1 What is playing by ear? In this dissertation, I define playing by ear as the ability to reproduce an aurally presented melody on and instrument (including the voice). To play well by ear means to reproduce the musical properties of the heard melody accurately across relevant domains, such as pitch, interval and rhythmic structures. I note, that, precisely what these important musical structures to assess accuracy by are consist of is non-trivial, and something partly explored on this thesis. I thus leave the definition relatively general at this point. To play badly by ear means to struggle to reproduce the musical structures contained in the melody. Note that my definition separates playing by ear from “improvisation”, which is about spontaneously generating (new) ideas, not a faithful replication of that heard before. 4.2 Learning to play by ear I separate the general process of “playing by ear” from “learning to play by ear”, even though the two are intrinsically linked. “Playing by ear” presumes that the melody is sufficiently “prelearned” to be recalled almost perfectly. Conversely, learning to play by ear is a separate process, whereby the melody to be recalled is not yet stable enough in memory to be reproduced faithfully. It will take specifically at least more than one attempt to be recalled accurately - potentially “revised” - or may not be recallable in a given session. Thus, learning requires multiple attempts. Learning also requires that improvements are made over attempts, in the relative short term (Silas and Müllensiefen 2023), but also over longer time periods.

The development of aural skills — often described as “playing by ear” — has been a central feature of jazz learning, especially throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In this section, I describe the historical evolution of approaches to developing aural skills in jazz education, from early reliance on recordings to modern technological methods. I survey how record players, transcription books, and pattern books have supported the ear training process in jazz education and the evolving interplay between informal, aural traditions and formalised, institutional methods. This suggests a gradual shift from purely aural learning to increasingly systematised approaches, reflecting broader trends in the institutionalization of jazz education. Despite this evolution, the fundamental importance of developing acute listening skills remains central to effective jazz pedagogy. 5.1 The Aural Origins of Jazz Education The early history of jazz was characterised by learning that occurred primarily through aural means. As Herzig (2019) notes, this involved “hours of listening, transcribing, and participating in jam sessions” before formal educational approaches emerged. In this pre-institutional era, the transmission of jazz knowledge occurred organically within communities of practice, with experienced musicians serving as mentors to aspiring players. This master-apprentice relationship formed the foundation of early jazz pedagogy, where direct demonstration and immediate repetition were the primary teaching methods. The absence of formal jazz education in the early period necessitated this aural approach, as musicians needed to develop their skills through direct engagement with the music itself. While some things were written down, such as Downbeat magasine transcriptions in the 1940’s (Koger et al. 1985), the vast majority of what people learned and played was done by ear. This established a precedent that would continue to influence jazz pedagogy even as more formalised approaches developed. The emphasis on learning by ear ensured that early jazz musicians developed strong aural skills as a natural consequence of their training process. 5.2 Record Players as Pedagogical Tools The development of recording technology dramatically transformed jazz education by making the music of master performers accessible to aspiring musicians regardless of geographic location. Recordings became essential educational resources, allowing students to study the repertoire and improvisations of established artists (Acevedo 2014). This technological advancement democratized access to jazz education, extending learning opportunities beyond those who could physically attend performances or study with established musicians. Technologies such as variable-speed turntables and digital audio software enabled closer analysis, allowing students to slow down recordings for detailed ear training (Re 2004). Listening was an active engagement: learners would loop short segments, replicate phrases, and match articulation. The ability to repeatedly listen to recorded performances proved particularly valuable, especially since records could be “endlessly repeated” (Surber 2009). This repetition allowed students to internalize not only melodies and chord progressions but also nuances of style, tone, and expression that were difficult to communicate through written notation. The practice of slowing down recordings or lifting the needle to replay difficult passages became standard pedagogical techniques that allowed for deep analysis of complex musical passages. The phonograph was an indispensable tool for jazz learners. Listening to records enabled musicians to internalize jazz language and style. Berliner (1994) emphasises that imitation from recordings helped players build a mental library of harmonic and melodic ideas, forming a foundation for improvisation. Even as jazz moved into universities, listening retained primacy. Wilf (2012) describes rituals within jazz education that centre around repeated listening to canonical recordings—practices that continued to uphold the oral-aural traditions at the heart of jazz pedagogy. 5.3 Codification of Jazz Education The transition from purely aural learning to more systematized approaches began in the mid-20th century. Herzig (2019) identifies the 1930s as a pivotal period, with early attempts to codify jazz instruction including Norbert Bleihoof’s “Modern Arranging and Orchestration” (1935) and Lee Bowden’s training program for Afro-American Service Musicians at the Great Lakes Naval Base (1942-45). These initial efforts to systematize jazz education represented the beginning of a shift toward more formalised instructional approaches, though they remained relatively limited in scope. Whilst transcribing solos has historically been a core method of ear training in jazz. Berliner (1994) and Re (2004) argue that the act of transcribing by ear strengthens aural recognition and improvisational understanding. However, the rise of printed transcription books—like the Charlie Parker Omnibook—introduced shifts in practice. While these books provided accessible models for study, Witmer and Robbins (1988) found that many early transcription collections failed to support active listening. The danger, they argue, lies in students relying on notation rather than using their ears. Generally, transcription is thought most effective when used in tandem with active listening—students should first attempt to transcribe by ear and then use notated versions for verification or analysis (Berliner 1994; Re 2004) 5.4 The Chord-Scale Approach, Pattern Books and Vocabulary Acquisition A watershed moment in jazz education came in the late 1960s, with what Herzig terms “the ABCs of jazz” - referring to the influential work of Jamey Aebersold, David Baker, and Jerry Coker. Their development of comprehensive instructional materials, including Baker’s “Jazz Improvisation: a Comprehensive Method for all Players” (1969) and Aebersold’s play-along recordings, established a framework for jazz education that continues to influence pedagogical approaches today. These materials helped standardize jazz instruction and made it more accessible to students without direct access to master performers, contributing to what Prouty describes as the “wholesale growth” of jazz education during the 1960s and 70s. The chord-scale approach pioneered by Baker, Aebersold, and Coker became a dominant paradigm in jazz education. These influential educators “focus on scales and modes to examine improvisation” (Spice 2010). This approach provided students with systematic frameworks for navigating harmonic structures, offering concrete tools for developing improvisational facility. The emphasis on scales and patterns created a more accessible entry point for students transitioning from classical training to jazz improvisation. Aebersold’s own description of his pedagogical evolution reveals the gradual systematization of his approach: “I published my first jazz play-a-long in 1967 and the [accompanying] booklet included concert [key] chords for each track. Subsequent printings added transposed chord symbols [for Bb and Eb instruments] and, eventually, I added the needed transposed scales and chords for each track”. This approach represented a compromise between purely aural learning and more visually-oriented instructional methods, coupling “the eye with the ear” in ways that provided students with multiple pathways for internalizing jazz vocabulary. The development of pattern books and play-along recordings created standardized resources that facilitated the institutional teaching of jazz improvisation. Pattern books, such as Coker’s Patterns for Jazz and Baker’s Improvisational Patterns, systematized jazz vocabulary through short, transposable licks and exercises. Witmer and Robbins (1988) recognize their role in helping students internalize chord-scale relationships and idiomatic phrases. However, these tools also sparked criticism. Benward and Wildman (1984) caution that over-reliance can yield formulaic improvisation disconnected from the spontaneous, reactive nature of jazz. Wilf (2012) views pattern books as part of a broader institutional shift from oral tradition to codified curriculum. Educators like Coker (1964) emphasised integrating these resources with listening and improvisation. Used as an ear-training aid, patterns could reinforce melodic shapes and harmonic contexts, provided students also engaged with recordings and creative application. 5.5 The Influence of John Coltrane John Coltrane’s approach to improvisation, characterized by systematic exploration of harmonic possibilities, had a profound impact on jazz pedagogy. Research examining Coltrane’s melodic vocabulary reveals his methodical approach to developing improvisational frameworks, including his systematic exploration of harmonic structures through patterns and exercises. His disciplined practice methods and innovative harmonic concepts established new paradigms for jazz improvisation that would be incorporated into educational approaches. Coltrane’s influence extended beyond his specific musical innovations to encompass his overall approach to musical development. His systematic exploration of musical possibilities demonstrated the value of structured practice and theoretical understanding alongside intuitive improvisation. Scholars have analyzed Coltrane’s use of pitch-class sets and other patterns, noting the “potential influence of Nicolas Slonimsky’s Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns (1947)”. This connection between Coltrane’s innovative improvisational approach and Slonimsky’s theoretical work illustrates the emerging synthesis between systematized approaches and creative expression in jazz education. 5.6 Slonimsky’s Thesaurus and Jazz Improvisation Nicolas Slonimsky’s “Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns” (Slonimsky 1947) represents a significant intersection between theoretical systems and jazz improvisation. Although originally conceived as a classical resource, the text became influential among jazz musicians seeking to expand their improvisational vocabulary. According to research on Coltrane’s musical development, “the influence of Nicolas Slonimsky’s Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns on the developing melodic vocabulary of John Coltrane was profound”. This adoption of Slonimsky’s work illustrates how jazz education has drawn from diverse sources beyond the jazz tradition itself. The Thesaurus provided jazz musicians with systematic approaches to exploring melodic possibilities within the twelve-tone chromatic scale. As noted in Joe Hubbard’s educational materials, the book “literally contains millions of permutations based on the equal intervallic divisions of the 12-tone chromatic scale” and was utilized by numerous influential jazz musicians including “John Coltrane, Pat Martino, Herbie Hancock, and Jaco Pastorius”. The application of these patterns to jazz contexts demonstrates how theoretical systems could be adapted to serve improvisational purposes, expanding the vocabulary available to jazz improvisers while maintaining connections to the aural tradition. – In 1947, the Russian-American composer Nicolas Slonimsky who was “obsessed with twelve-tone rows” (Feisst 2011) produced a seminal book in music theory: the Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns (from here referred to as the Slonimsky’s Thesaurus; Slonimsky, 1947). As suggested by its title, the book is an exhaustive collection of musical melodies which Slonimsky laboriously generated manually and systematically. The purpose of such a volume was to provide a repository of musical melodies which breaks free of traditional tonal harmonic principles. In other words, it was an attempt to systematically open up possibilities in the Western Music system which had not yet been explored. Slonimsky’s undertaking can be viewed as a way of codifying and unlocking the potential of music through systematization; it highlights that by algorithimic thinking, new possibilities can be unleashed. As such, Slonimsky’s volume fascinated.. Coltrane … Zappa. One basic principle behind Slonimsky’s systematization was to divide one or more octaves of the twelve-tone system into symmetrical intervals and, from there, systematically interpolate different numbers of notes between the intervals created by the divisions. Additionally, he used other formulae to generate melodic patterns which had not yet been yield by his basic scheme. Of The Thesaurus, Schoenberg wrote to Slonimsky, “you might [have] in all probability organized every possible succession of tones” and referred to his work as “an admirable feast of mental gymnastics”. Whilst the former is almost certainly not true (unless constrained to a length, the possibilities of melodies are infinite), the latter is undoubtedly. However, such a task would now be solved at ease by a script on a modern computer. =&gt; Coltrane’s use represents a desire to move from simply “learning the oral tradition” to developing new melodic ideas. pedagogical “tried-and-tested” vs. aspirational melodic vocabularies – https://books.google.de/books/about/Perfect_Pitch.html?id=V1cIAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y https://wiki.killuglyradio.com/wiki/Nicolas_Slonimsky 5.7 Modern Technological Approaches to Ear Training Contemporary approaches to ear training have leveraged technological advancements to create new pedagogical tools. The development of online ear training platforms has expanded access to structured practice resources, as described by IWasDoingAllRight: “Ear training has been a regular part of my practice routine since the beginning of 2004, when I created the first version of my free online ear training tool”. These digital tools allow students to practice identifying intervals, chords, and progressions with immediate feedback, providing structured approaches to developing aural skills that complement traditional transcription practices. The range of technological resources has continued to expand, with applications designed to address specific aspects of ear training. As documented by JazzAdvice, contemporary jazz ear training must prepare musicians for the complex demands of real-time improvisation, including the ability to “learn tunes from recordings” and “hear chord changes and progressions easily”. Modern digital tools address these needs through targeted exercises focusing on intervals, chord qualities, voicings, and progressions. These technological approaches maintain connections to the aural tradition while providing more systematic pathways for skill development. 5.8 Integration of Technology in Educational Settings Educational institutions have increasingly incorporated technological tools into their ear training curricula. Research from Silpakorn University describes a jazz ear training course that utilized “teaching materials (e.g., exercises, audio files, demonstration clips, and videos)” delivered through Google Classroom during the COVID-19 pandemic. This integration of digital resources allowed for continued instruction despite physical distancing requirements, illustrating the adaptability of contemporary ear training approaches. The adaptation of traditional methods to digital formats represents an evolution rather than a revolution in jazz ear training pedagogy. As described in “Tools For Ear Training Pedagogy,” contemporary approaches continue to emphasize the development of core aural skills while leveraging technology to enhance access and efficiency. The research conducted through interviews with thirteen music educators and professionals confirms that while the tools have evolved, the fundamental goal remains developing the ability to perceive and reproduce musical sounds accurately. This continued emphasis on aural skills maintains connections to jazz’s origins as an aural tradition even as educational approaches become increasingly sophisticated. 5.9 Conclusion Record players, transcription books, and pattern books have each contributed to jazz ear training across the 20th and 21st centuries. Academic literature affirms that while written and technological resources are valuable, they must be embedded in a pedagogy that privileges listening. The most enduring jazz learning strategies integrate tools into a broader aural framework—preserving the tradition of learning music by ear, even in modern academic contexts The historical development of approaches to improving playing by ear in jazz pedagogy reveals a gradual evolution from purely aural learning to increasingly systematized methods. As Liebman argues in his discussion of transcription practices, this process involves “a three part learning process: body, mind and spirit-in that order”. This holistic view recognizes that effective ear training integrates physical, intellectual, and intuitive aspects of musical development, reflecting the multifaceted nature of jazz improvisation itself. Despite the increasing systematization of jazz education, the fundamental importance of aural learning remains. Louise Denson’s work on Third Stream Ear Training at the Queensland Conservatorium acknowledges that “aural training for improvisers is a specialized area of musicianship” requiring both “conventional skills” and “a high level of aural awareness which permits real-time reactions to a variety of musical stimuli and contexts”. This recognition of the unique demands placed on jazz improvisers has led to specialized approaches that maintain connections to the aural tradition while incorporating more structured pedagogical methods. The continued evolution of ear training approaches in jazz education reflects broader trends in the field, balancing respect for traditional aural learning with recognition of the benefits offered by more systematized methods and technological tools. This integration of approaches provides contemporary students with multiple pathways for developing the aural skills essential to effective jazz performance. As jazz education continues to evolve, maintaining this balance between aural tradition and systematized instruction remains a central challenge and opportunity for jazz pedagogy.

These approaches are: systematic musicological, psychological, and computational. In general, these approaches come from the scientific approach. 6.1 Playing by Ear: Cognitive Foundations, Developmental Trajectories, and Practical Strategies in Musical Ear-Playing 6.1.1 Introduction Playing by ear the ability to learn and perform music without written notation – is a widespread phenomenon across cultures and genres. As one of the foremost playing by ear researchers, Robert Woody has stated, “around the world and throughout human history, aural transmission of music and ear-based performance are the norm” .By contrast, Western formal music training has traditionally emphasised reading notation, sometimes undervaluing ear-playing. However, recent research in cognitive psychology, music psychology, and systematic musicology has illuminated playing by ear as a fundamental musicianship skill with broad benefits. Woody (2019) argues that excluding ear-based musicianship from learning “removes the humanness from music making” newsroom.unl.edu , whereas developing the ability to play by ear can enhance overall musical proficiency for all performers – not only those in popular or jazz genres newsroom.unl.edu . Indeed, playing by ear is described as a “foundational skill” that supports sight-reading, memorization, and interpretive understanding of music newsroom.unl.edu . Jazz and other improvisatory traditions have long treated learning by ear as essential; jazz musicians commonly learn repertoire and improvisational vocabulary by listening and imitating recordings, which is considered crucial for developing stylistic fluency. This review provides an in-depth overview of the literature on playing by ear, focusing on three key areas: (1) cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying playing by ear, (2) developmental and pedagogical aspects of acquiring playing by ear skills, and (3) practical strategies and individual differences in learning and applying playing by ear, including insights from jazz and professional musicians. All sections draw on peer-reviewed research, emphasizing findings in jazz and expert populations while also integrating relevant studies on general music learners. 6.2 Cognitive and Neural Mechanisms Underlying Playing by Ear Auditory Imagery and Mental Representation: A central cognitive component of playing by ear is auditory imagery – the ability to internally hear or imagine music without external sound. Skilled ear-players exhibit strong auditory imagery capacities, which enable them to anticipate and mentally “hear” pitches and phrases before playing them. Cognitive studies have found that auditory imagery can guide performance by activating sensorimotor representations: imagining sounds that correspond to specific instrumental actions can trigger the motor programs for those actions frontiersin.org . In other words, when an experienced musician internally hears a melody, that imagery is closely coupled with the fingerings or movements needed to produce it frontiersin.org . This aligns with the concept of audiation in music education (Gordon, 1999), whereby musicians “hear” music in their mind as a precursor to performing it. Neuroimaging evidence further supports this auditory–motor linkage. For example, studies show that simply imagining musical sequences engages regions of the brain’s motor planning network in trained musicians frontiersin.org . Keller (2012) noted that mental imagery in music performance serves important functions such as planning upcoming notes and monitoring intonation. In the context of playing by ear, expert musicians form rich mental representations of pieces, often encoding not just the melodic contour but also harmonic and structural features. Research by Woody (2020) demonstrated that musicians highly skilled in ear-playing use “harmonically oriented integrated cognitive strategies,” whereas less experienced ear-players rely on more fragmentary, note-by-note approaches ouci.dntb.gov.ua . In Woody’s study, university music students who were guided to focus on a melody’s underlying chord progression developed a more substantive “goal image” of the tune, which in turn improved their ability to learn it by ear ouci.dntb.gov.ua . This indicates that adding harmonic context to one’s auditory imagery (for instance, knowing the chord changes) leads to more robust mental representations and facilitates ear-playing. Thus, proficient playing by ear involves vivid auditory imagery and schema-like memory for musical patterns, especially harmonic frameworks. Working Memory and Anticipation: Playing music by ear also engages working memory and long-term memory in unique ways. Musicians must temporarily hold incoming auditory information (the sounds just heard) while simultaneously planning and executing motor responses on their instrument. This places demands on the phonological loop (for retaining pitch sequences) as well as the integration of auditory and motor memory. Studies have explored how working memory for musical material might differ between those who rely on ear-playing and those who rely on notation. Nichols, Wöllner, and Halpern (2018) compared jazz and classically trained musicians on auditory working memory tasks and found notable differences researchgate.net researchgate.net . Jazz players – who typically emphasize learning by ear – outperformed classical players in remembering and reproducing heard melodies, especially when they had to play back the melodies on an instrument researchgate.net . In this study, musicians were asked to recall the final notes of sequences after a distraction, either by writing/singing or by playing them on a piano. Jazz musicians showed superior recall for aurally presented melodies when responding instrumentally (playing by ear), and their scores positively correlated with years of jazz experience researchgate.net researchgate.net . The authors concluded that extensive ear-playing and improvisation experience can enhance domain-specific working memory capacity – essentially, jazz training tunes the cognitive system to better handle musical information in real time. Furthermore, ear-trained musicians often develop efficient cognitive chunking strategies. Instead of processing every note in isolation, they rely on familiar patterns and harmonic sequences stored in long-term memory. When reproducing a melody by ear, skilled musicians may anticipate likely chord progressions or melodic resolutions based on their internalized musical grammar. This predictive listening reduces memory load by allowing the musician to generate expectations. Indeed, Woody and Lehmann (2010) found that musicians with extensive vernacular (informal) music experience could learn melodies by ear with fewer repetitions than classically trained musicians, thanks in part to better anticipation of melodic/harmonic patterns eric.ed.gov . The ear-trained players applied a “more sophisticated knowledge base to generate accurate expectations” about how the melody would unfold eric.ed.gov . In contrast, formally trained players without strong ear-playing backgrounds used less efficient, more surface-level strategies for encoding melodies eric.ed.gov . This implies that cognitive schemas and pattern knowledge (acquired largely through listening and imitating) free up working memory resources during playing by ear by providing ready-made chunks and expectations. Pitch Processing and Audiation: A fundamental skill for playing by ear is precise pitch perception – the ability to identify and reproduce notes and intervals. Many ear players develop acute relative pitch skills, allowing them to recognize scale degrees or chord tones by ear and map them to their instrument. Some research has examined the role of absolute pitch (AP) in ear-playing as well. While AP (the rare ability to identify pitches without a reference) can aid certain tasks, most musicians rely on well-honed relative pitch and tonal schema to play by ear in real musical contexts. For instance, learning a song by ear often involves detecting its tonal center and scale, recognizing common chord progressions (e.g. the 12-bar blues or II–V–I progression in jazz), and using those frameworks to guide note choices. Johansson (2004), in a study of rock musicians, observed that ear players often identify familiar “clichés, harmonic formulas and other stylistic traits” of the genre to decode songs on the fly researchgate.net . In other words, they listen for characteristic chord patterns or melodic motifs, which helps them predict upcoming pitches. This genre-dependent pattern recognition underscores that ear-playing proficiency is partly a product of genre-specific listening experience. Musicians essentially build a library of musical phrases and progressions in memory by extensive listening; when a new piece is heard, they match it to known patterns. Over time, this process can become quite automatic. There is evidence that such auditory–tonal knowledge develops naturally with immersion: longitudinal studies of children (e.g., McPherson, 2005) suggest that students who engage in informal music making (like picking out tunes by ear or jamming) often show improved ear-playing ability even without formal ear-training repository.canterbury.ac.uk . In summary, cognitive mechanisms of pitch processing in playing by ear involve both fine-grained perception (discriminating pitches and intervals) and higher-order schema (tonal and stylistic expectations), all coordinated through the musician’s auditory imagery and memory systems. Sensorimotor Integration and Neural Basis: Perhaps the most striking aspect of playing by ear is the seamless integration of heard sound with motor action. This audiomotor integration means that when an experienced musician hears a melody (externally or internally), their brain quickly maps those sounds to the required finger movements or vocal actions. Neuroscientific research has shed light on the brain networks that enable this feat. In skilled musicians, auditory and motor regions of the brain form strong bidirectional connections due to training. Novembre and Keller (2014) review evidence that musical training “couples” perception and action systems, such that perceiving a musical phrase can automatically activate the motor program to play it frontiersin.org frontiersin.org . This reflects the brain’s general action–perception coupling mechanism, where anticipated effects (like a heard note) can trigger the motor command associated with producing that effect frontiersin.org . In the context of ear-playing, this means a violinist might hear a phrase in their mind and feel the impulse to execute the fingerings and bowings, or a pianist hearing a chord might internally rehearse the hand shape required. A vivid demonstration of advanced audiomotor integration is seen in jazz improvisers. Harris, van Kranenburg, and de Jong (2016) compared improvising pianists with classical score-dependent pianists in their ability to reproduce unfamiliar melodies by ear. They found that the improvising (ear-trained) musicians had a “superior ability… to replicate both the pitch and rhythm of aurally perceived music at the keyboard, not only in the original key, but also in other tonalities” journals.plos.org . In other words, those accustomed to playing by ear could accurately pick up a tune and immediately play it and even transpose it, far outperforming the note-bound players. The same study linked this behavioral skill to neural differences: an fMRI comparison revealed that improvising musicians showed enhanced activation in a right dorsal fronto-parietal network during audiation tasks, suggesting more efficient neural pathways for audiomotor transformations journals.plos.org . These brain regions (including posterior parietal and premotor cortices) are thought to support mapping auditory inputs to motor responses journals.plos.org journals.plos.org . Likewise, Limb and Braun’s (2008) pioneering fMRI study of jazz improvisation found that spontaneous musical creation involves distinct neural dynamics (including heightened activity in motor-planning areas and the suppression of self-monitoring regions), illustrating the brain’s adaptation to real-time ear-to-hand performance. Collectively, such research underscores that playing by ear is a whole-brain activity: it recruits auditory perception circuits, memory and planning areas, and motor execution networks in a tightly coordinated loop. With training, this loop becomes highly optimized – as seen in professionals who can hear a melody once and immediately play it. Sensorimotor integration is thus at the core of playing by ear, enabling the immediate translation of heard musical ideas into played music. Developmental and Pedagogical Aspects of playing by ear Skill Acquisition Early Development and Informal Learning: How do musicians acquire the ability to play by ear? Developmental studies indicate that playing by ear can emerge at surprisingly early stages given the right exposure. Many children first experience music informally – singing songs, copying melodies by ear on piano or guitar, improvising little tunes – often well before they read notation. Research by Gary McPherson (1997, 2005) followed young instrumental students over time and found that those who engaged in activities like singing or picking out tunes by ear showed enhanced musical understanding in the long run repository.canterbury.ac.uk . McPherson noted that having beginners “sing before playing” an instrument helps them internalize pitch and rhythm, which later aids in connecting sound to symbols (notation). In essence, early ear-playing experiences allow children to embody music – linking what they hear to what their fingers do – which lays a cognitive foundation for all subsequent musical learning. Another early study by Gerber (1992) suggested that skill in playing by ear often develops naturally through unguided exploration: children who spend time noodling on their instrument, figuring out favorite tunes by ear, tend to improve in that ability through self-discovery. Such findings align with anecdotal observations that many talented ear-players are self-taught or began learning informally (e.g. picking up guitar chords from recordings or learning folk tunes by ear). In popular music contexts, it is common for beginners to start with imitation of recordings, gradually building a repertoire of songs by ear (Green, 2002). Overall, developmental evidence supports the idea that given exposure and opportunity, learners will cultivate ear-playing competencies even without formal instruction – though formal training can further refine and expand these skills. Formal Pedagogy and Ear-Training: Despite its evident benefits, playing by ear has not always been systematically incorporated into formal music education. Traditional Western pedagogy, especially in classical music, has heavily focused on notation literacy and technical exercises, with ear-playing sometimes regarded as a lesser skill or even a distraction. Nonetheless, a growing body of pedagogical research advocates for integrating playing by ear into teaching curricula for its positive impact on musicianship. Baker and Green (2013) conducted a landmark “Ear Playing Project” experiment with 10–14 year-old students in the UK, providing one group of students with regular opportunities to learn melodies by ear from recordings (instead of from notation) while a control group received only traditional instruction. After a period of instruction, all students were given standardized aural tests that required them to play back melodies and rhythms by ear. The results were striking: the ear-playing group surpassed the control group in every criterion (pitch accuracy, rhythmic accuracy, melodic contour, tempo, etc.) on the post-tests eric.ed.gov eric.ed.gov . In other words, those who practiced learning music by ear showed significantly greater improvement in aural skills than those who only learned through notation. This evidence strongly suggests that incorporating ear-playing in lessons can enhance students’ aural development. Notably, these gains did not come at the expense of other skills; instead, ear-playing experience appeared to reinforce musical memory and understanding that also benefit reading and performing. Parallel research by Musco (2010) and Woody (2012) addressed a common concern among music teachers that spending time on by-ear learning might impede music reading progress repository.canterbury.ac.uk . Their findings counter this worry: students can learn to play by ear and to read music in tandem, with each skill informing the other. In fact, Woody (2012) argued that ear skills make students more sensitive and “musical” when reading notation, since they are not just decoding notes on the page but internally hearing and understanding them newsroom.unl.edu . Recognizing these advantages, educational approaches like Suzuki method (for violin and other instruments) have long emphasized early ear training—students learn tunes by ear first, delaying notation, which purportedly develops strong listening and memory skills. Similarly, contemporary methods in popular music education (e.g., Lucy Green’s informal learning approach) deliberately use playing by ear in group teaching: students might be tasked with figuring out a pop song by listening to a recording together, fostering collaborative ear-learning. Teachers who have tried these approaches often report increased student engagement. For example, Varvarigou (2014) examined instrumental teachers’ experiences when they introduced “copying by ear” tasks in one-to-one lessons as part of the Ear Playing Project. Teachers adopted various strategies, such as singing or humming phrases to prompt students, asking guiding questions, and giving positive feedback while students learned songs by ear eric.ed.gov . By the end of the project, the teachers noted that incorporating ear-playing provided “a new and enjoyable way” to work on aural skills and even boosted their own confidence in teaching by ear eric.ed.gov . They observed that students seemed to enjoy lessons more, showed improved improvisation abilities, and grew more confident on their instruments through these activities eric.ed.gov . These qualitative outcomes echo formal test results: playing by ear can increase musical enjoyment and creativity, likely because it is a more naturally immersive way to learn music than reading alone. Jazz Education and Professional Development: In jazz, learning by ear has always been fundamental, and research on jazz pedagogy provides insights into advanced playing by ear skill development. Jazz educators encourage students to transcribe solos by ear (i.e. learn them by listening and reproducing, sometimes writing them down afterward) and to learn tunes from recordings rather than fakebooks. This practice not only ingrains repertoire, but also develops the aural vocabulary needed for improvisation. Ethnographic work, such as Paul Berliner’s Thinking in Jazz (1994), documents how jazz legends acquired their craft: virtually all spent countless hours listening to records, imitating phrasing and solos, and jamming informally – all ear-driven learning. Systematic studies reinforce this: for example, a study of collegiate jazz improvisers by Martin Norgaard (2011) found that expert improvisers rely heavily on musical memory during performance. In interviews, professional jazz musicians described their improvisational thinking as a mix of prelearned phrases (licks) retrieved from memory, and spontaneous creation guided by ear eric.ed.gov . They reported that while improvising, they often recall well-learned ideas from memory and insert them, or choose notes based on an internal auditory priority (what they hear as the next phrase) rather than a purely theoretical formula eric.ed.gov . This again highlights the primacy of the ear: even at high expertise, what sounds right (shaped by extensive listening and internal audiation) directs the performance. The developmental implication is that advanced improvisational skill is built on a huge reservoir of learned-by-ear musical fragments and the ability to manipulate them in the moment. Consequently, jazz training at the professional level continues to emphasize ear training throughout a musician’s development. Many jazz programs include dedicated ear-training courses focused on recognizing chord progressions, melodies, and rhythms by ear. Beyond formal classes, mentorship in jazz often involves listening assignments and “call and response” imitation exercises in ensembles. All of these pedagogical practices reinforce the link between hearing and doing, which is at the heart of playing by ear. It is worth noting that not all learners find playing by ear equally intuitive – there are individual differences, and some may initially struggle with it if they have been exclusively notation-focused. However, pedagogues suggest that playing by ear can be nurtured in most students with patience. Starting with simple, familiar tunes (like folk songs) and having students figure them out by trial and error is a common approach. Students gradually learn to teach themselves music by ear, which is a powerful skill for lifelong learning. In summary, research in music education converges on the idea that integrating ear-playing experiences – whether through informal learning projects, ear-training exercises, or improvisational activities – significantly enriches musical development. It produces musicians who are more well-rounded, confident, creative, and able to adapt to new musical situations (a crucial trait for professionals). Ear-playing is no longer seen as mere talent or trick; it is increasingly recognized as a pedagogical tool and an objective of instruction in its own right. Practical Strategies and Individual Differences in playing by ear Learning Strategies for Playing by Ear: Given the cognitive demands of playing by ear, musicians employ a variety of strategies to make the process efficient. One key strategy is chunking, as mentioned earlier – breaking the music into manageable units (whether melodic phrases, chord progressions, or rhythmic patterns). For instance, an ear-player might not think of a song as a sequence of 20 individual notes, but rather as a few melodic motifs and underlying chords. By identifying these chunks, the musician reduces what they have to remember and can more easily match what they play to what they heard. Another strategy is slow-down and repetition: many learners, including professionals, will loop difficult passages and slow them (a practice made easier with modern technology) to parse out details by ear. This is essentially applied analytical listening. Self-regulated learning plays a big role here – musicians often guide their own ear-learning process by setting small goals (e.g., “figure out just the bass line first” or “hum the melody before touching the instrument”), monitoring their accuracy, and adjusting their approach. Studies on practicing have found that skilled learners tend to audibly verify what they learned (e.g., singing a phrase to check it matches the original) and isolate trouble spots in their practice routines, which are hallmarks of self-regulation. While formal literature on self-regulated learning and ear-playing specifically is limited, we can draw parallels: effectively, when playing by ear, the musician is constantly assessing by listening – a feedback loop between output and the target sound. This builds not only the ear but also general problem-solving skills in music. Indeed, providing “opportunities for self-initiated learning and non-evaluated practice” – where students explore without immediate external correction – has been suggested as crucial for developing confidence in ear-playing repository.canterbury.ac.uk . Such unguided exploration allows individuals to discover what strategies work best for them, whether it’s trial-and-error, visualizing the music, or relying on muscle memory. Improvisation and Creativity: Improvisation is closely intertwined with playing by ear, as both involve real-time generation of music without reading. Many studies of improvisation emphasize the role of the ear: improvisers are essentially composing with their instrument in real time, and to do so, they must listen – to the accompanying music, to their own ideas as they unfold, and to an internal sense of where the music could go next. Psychological models of improvisation (e.g., Pressing, 1988; Johnson-Laird, 2002) propose that improvisers use a repertoire of memorized licks plus generative rules to create new solos. The selection and execution of those licks is guided by auditory feedback: a player might hear a motif in their head and immediately play it, then listen to what they just played and let that spark the next idea. Norgaard’s 2011 study of expert jazz improvisers illustrated this iterative process of planning, executing, and monitoring during solos eric.ed.gov eric.ed.gov . The musicians described constantly evaluating their output (“was that phrase good? should I repeat it or change it?”) and making adjustments on the fly eric.ed.gov . This improvisational thinking requires a well-trained ear to judge one’s musical statements and to hear possibilities before playing them. Because of this, exercises that strengthen playing by ear are often recommended to aspiring improvisers. For example, practicing call-and-response (where a teacher sings a phrase and the student plays it back) improves the ability to quickly translate heard ideas into played ideas – essentially building the reflexes needed for improvising. The role of individual learning styles also emerges here: some improvisers are more theory-oriented (they think in terms of scales, chord tones, and intellectual structures), whereas others are more aural (they rely on their ear and muscle memory of patterns). While both approaches can lead to effective improvisation, those with stronger aural skills often demonstrate more fluidity and originality, since they are not as constrained by theoretical rules in the moment but instead follow the sound they imagine. In any case, the consensus in jazz education is that a strong ear is indispensable for true improvisational freedom. Formal vs. Informal Training and Individual Trajectories: An important theme in playing by ear research is the contrast between formally trained musicians and those from informal backgrounds (such as self-taught popular musicians). Studies consistently show differences in how these groups learn and approach ear-playing. As discussed, Woody and Lehmann (2010) found that college music students with vernacular (informal) experiences needed significantly fewer trials to learn melodies by ear than their strictly classically trained peers eric.ed.gov . The formally trained musicians often struggled initially because their habits were tied to written cues and deliberate practice of technique; they tended to focus on “physically producing the melodies” (e.g. thinking about finger positions) instead of listening to the melody as a whole eric.ed.gov . In contrast, the informal-trained students had automated much of the motor execution, allowing them to focus attention on the sound itself eric.ed.gov . This finding echoes many anecdotal observations in music teaching: students coming from church bands, garage bands, or other informal environments often have a natural ease with picking up songs by ear and playing with others, whereas conservatory-trained students might excel at reading and technique but initially feel “lost” without sheet music. Of course, these differences are not immutable – formal training can incorporate ear skills, and informal musicians can learn theory and reading. The point is that early experiences shape one’s musical orientation. Individual differences in auditory memory, motivation, and even personality (e.g. willingness to take risks) can also affect playing by ear ability. Some individuals seem to have a proclivity for learning by ear; researchers like Peter Mishra (2014) have speculated about auditory working memory capacity or auditory imagery vividness as factors that might make one person a stronger ear-learner than another. However, the overarching message from the literature is that playing by ear is trainable. Even those who do not consider themselves naturally good at it can improve with practice and the right strategies. For instance, a case study by Creech et al. (2008) showed that adult classical musicians, when encouraged to learn simple tunes by ear as part of a workshop, made substantial progress and reported it positively impacted their listening skills. Finally, a practical consideration is the use of technology in learning by ear. Modern tools (like slowing down apps, backing tracks, YouTube tutorials that teach by demonstration, etc.) have made ear-learning more accessible. While older generations might have lifted the record needle repeatedly to catch notes, today’s students can loop sections digitally. This doesn’t diminish the skill – it potentially accelerates it by providing clearer feedback. The core process remains: listening, decoding, and performing. But with or without technology, the research-backed strategies remain: sing the part (to ensure you really know how it should sound), break music into sections, use theory as a guide (e.g. recognizing “this passage outlines a D7 chord, so I expect these chord tones”), and most importantly, listen actively. As one educator summarized, “ear playing is learned by playing by ear” researchgate.net – meaning the best way to get better is simply to do it, genre by genre, song by song, gradually building the mental library and reflexes that enable ever more fluent playing by ear. Conclusion The phenomenon of playing by ear sits at the intersection of cognitive skill, pedagogical practice, and musical creativity. From a cognitive standpoint, playing by ear engages complex mental processes: vivid auditory imagery, specialized working memory, pattern recognition, and a tight coupling of perception and action. Neuroscience suggests that extensive ear-playing experience can even shape the brain, leading to more efficient audiomotor networks (as seen in improvising musicians). Developmentally, learning to play by ear can begin early and flourish in environments that encourage informal exploration. Incorporating ear-playing into formal instruction – as research in music education has shown – yields benefits for aural skills, musical understanding, and student motivation. In jazz and other professional domains, playing by ear is not only a skill to acquire but a mode of musical existence: it underpins the ability to improvise and to connect with music on a deeply intuitive level. Individual differences certainly influence how people approach playing by ear, yet studies underline that with the right strategies and experiences, virtually any musician can improve their ear-playing ability. This rich body of literature refutes the old notion that playing by ear is a mysterious gift; instead, it is a multifaceted skill set that can be analyzed, taught, and learned. As Woody (2019) observed, developing ear-based musicianship imbues music making with a certain “humanness” newsroom.unl.edu – it reconnects performers with the fundamentally aural nature of music. In practical terms, musicians who play by ear often learn new material faster, memorize more effectively, and perform with greater expressivity and flexibility newsroom.unl.edu . For educators, the implication is clear: fostering playing by ear alongside other skills produces more well-rounded and versatile musicians. For researchers, playing by ear remains a fertile topic, raising questions about auditory cognition, expert memory, and even cross-cultural musical learning. The literature so far, grounded in cognitive psychology, music psychology, and systematic musicology, provides a compelling case that playing by ear is both an essential subject of study and an invaluable aspect of musical praxis – from the novice learner picking out a tune, to the jazz virtuoso crafting a solo, guided all the while by the inner ear. 6.3 Musicological Perspectives 6.3.1 Music and combinatorics The derivation of Slonimsky’s Thesaurus - a new to document and rationalise logical melodic vocabulary - leads to a more general issue around combinatorics and musical (melodic) material. Introduce notion of large melodic learning vocabularies (LMLVs), ? # library(musiccombinatoricsr) 6.3.2 Melody as Cognitive Psychology / Melodic represention (herbornFeaturesPerceptionConstruction2022?) 6.3.3 Computed melodic features as a solution to selecting items 6.3.4 Pattern books as item banks The book has at least 1,400 discrete items and some of the patterns are terrifically long and complicated. Additionally, nearly all of the melodies are presented from a single note, C, and could be transposed to start on the other 11 chromatic tones. This means there are at least 16,800 (12 * 1400) items to be learned. The author’s saxophone tutor, who was a virtuoso, once said, “Oh, don’t bother trying to learn [Slonimsky’s Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns] systematically”. This was a wise comment since, as there is so much information, it is almost impossible for a human to comprehend and track their learning of it systematically. However, with advances in computation, this is a relatively easy challenge to solve once the data is in digital form. The author entered the Slonimsky’s Thesaurus corpus into his computer to provide a digital representation. This corpus will remain the test case for description in this document later on. 6.4 Music Psychology/Music Education 6.5 Cognitive Psychology General Principles of Learning and Memory: A Cognitive Psychology Perspective Introduction Learning and memory are fundamental cognitive processes that allow us to acquire new knowledge and retain it over time. Psychologists have long sought to understand how we learn and why we forget. Early experimental work established basic patterns of memory retention and loss that remain influential today. For example, pioneering studies by Hermann Ebbinghaus in the 1880s laid the groundwork for formal memory research by charting how quickly information is forgotten laplab.ucsd.edu . Since then, cognitive psychology has built a rich literature on the principles underlying learning and forgetting. This review provides an overview of general principles of learning and memory from a cognitive perspective, with an emphasis on how these principles manifest in both short-term and long-term memory. We will discuss historical findings (such as Ebbinghaus’s forgetting curve and Jenkins &amp; Dallenbach’s work on memory and sleep), examine the phenomena of learning and forgetting curves in different time scales, and explore the effectiveness of spaced repetition as a learning technique. We also highlight a recent computational model of memory – the DASH model (Difficulty, Ability, and Study History) by Mozer and Lindsey (2017) – and discuss how these cognitive principles are applied in modern language learning approaches and apps. Throughout, we ground the review in peer-reviewed findings to ensure academic rigor while keeping the explanations accessible to a general audience. Theoretical Background Memory Systems and Retention: Cognitive psychology distinguishes between short-term memory and long-term memory in terms of both capacity and duration. Short-term memory (often equated with working memory) is a limited storage that holds information for mere seconds if not actively rehearsed ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . In contrast, long-term memory can retain information for days, years, or even a lifetime. These two memory systems differ not only in duration but also in function and mechanism ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . Short-term memory acts as a mental “scratchpad” for immediate information processing (such as remembering a phone number long enough to dial it), whereas long-term memory stores more durable knowledge such as facts, personal experiences, and skills ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . The classic Atkinson-Shiffrin model (1968) conceptualized memory as a flow from transient sensory memory, to short-term memory, and eventually to long-term storage ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . While modern research has refined this modal model, the basic distinction remains useful: short-term memory is fleeting unless information is deliberately maintained or encoded into long-term memory. Learning and Forgetting Curves: One of the core findings in cognitive psychology is that both learning and forgetting tend to follow systematic, nonlinear patterns over time. A learning curve describes how performance or recall improves with repeated practice. Typically, learning is rapid initially, then the rate of improvement slows as one approaches mastery – a phenomenon often described as a negatively accelerated curve (early gains followed by plateau). Conversely, a forgetting curve describes how retained information is lost over time when no further practice occurs. Hermann Ebbinghaus was the first to quantitatively measure a forgetting curve. Using himself as a subject, Ebbinghaus memorized lists of nonsense syllables and tested his memory at various delays, from 20 minutes to 31 days. He found that forgetting occurs rapidly at first – a large proportion of the information is lost soon after learning – and then the rate of forgetting gradually slows down en.wikipedia.org laplab.ucsd.edu . In other words, memory retention drops steeply in the first hours or day, then levels off, never quite reaching zero. This characteristic shape has been replicated in modern studies. For instance, a 2015 replication of Ebbinghaus’s experiment confirmed the same pattern of a sharp initial decline followed by a more gradual loss, validating that the “forgetting curve” is a robust phenomenon journals.plos.org . Theoretical analyses of forgetting curves suggest that memory decay is not linear but follows a curve that can often be described by a mathematical function (historically debated as exponential or power-law in form) en.wikipedia.org laplab.ucsd.edu . The key practical implication is that most forgetting happens early, and what remains eventually stabilizes (information that survives the initial rapid forgetting may stay in memory for a long time). Short-Term vs. Long-Term Forgetting: The time scale of retention is crucial. In short-term memory, forgetting can occur on the order of seconds when rehearsal is prevented. Classic experiments by Peterson and Peterson (1959) demonstrated that without active rehearsal, even a simple piece of information (such as a trigram of letters) fades quickly from short-term memory. In their study, participants were asked to remember a three-letter sequence, then were prevented from rehearsing it by performing an intervening task (counting backwards) for a variable duration. The results showed a dramatic drop in recall within half a minute – after just 15–18 seconds of distraction, memory for the letters was almost completely gone (on the order of only ~5–10% of trigrams recalled correctly) psychologistworld.com . This rapid loss highlighted the very limited duration of short-term memory when maintenance via rehearsal is blocked. Long-term memory, on the other hand, operates over much longer intervals and is subject to different influences. Forgetting in long-term memory occurs more slowly and is heavily affected by factors such as meaningfulness of the material, repeated exposure, and interference from other learning. While time itself does contribute to forgetting, the role of interference is particularly evident in long-term retention. A famous study by Jenkins and Dallenbach (1924) provided early evidence that forgetting over several hours is not due solely to the passive decay of memory traces with time, but is exacerbated by waking activity (i.e. interference from new experiences). In this study, people learned nonsense syllables and were tested after a retention interval spent either sleeping or staying awake. The researchers found memory performance was significantly better after a period of sleep than after an equivalent period of wakefulness link.springer.com . During sleep, when little new information was encountered, participants forgot much less. The condition with wakefulness produced more forgetting, presumably because ongoing mental activities interfered with the previously learned syllables. Jenkins and Dallenbach concluded that interference plays a major role in forgetting: our memories fade faster when we are bombarded with new information (or other cognitive activity) in the interim. Later research on sleep and memory consolidation has reaffirmed that sleep can stabilize memories by protecting them against retroactive interference from new learning link.springer.com . In summary, short-term memory is fleeting unless actively maintained, and long-term memory, while more durable, is vulnerable to disruption by other experiences. These foundational insights set the stage for strategies to combat forgetting, such as managing interference and optimizing review timing. Key Findings from Cognitive Psychology Ebbinghaus’s Forgetting Curve: Hermann Ebbinghaus’s work in the 1880s was groundbreaking as the first systematic, quantitative study of human memory. Using the method of savings (measuring how many fewer trials were needed to relearn material after a delay), Ebbinghaus plotted the decline in memory retention over time. His forgetting curve showed that memory loss is steep soon after learning – he famously noted that more than half of learned syllables could be forgotten within hours – but then the curve flattens out en.wikipedia.org . For example, if 100% of information is remembered immediately after learning, a day later a much smaller fraction might be retained, and further losses after that point are slower. Ebbinghaus also observed that even when something seems forgotten, not all is necessarily lost; savings in relearning demonstrate that some residual memory can facilitate faster re-learning later en.wikipedia.org . The broader significance of Ebbinghaus’s finding is that forgetting is systematic rather than random. The initial rapid drop suggests a need for review soon after learning, while the leveling off indicates a core of memory that can persist. Ebbinghaus’s methods were primitive by today’s standards (he was his own sole test subject), yet remarkably, his results and general conclusions have stood the test of time en.wikipedia.org . Modern quantitative models still aim to describe the exact shape of the forgetting curve, with many agreeing that a negatively accelerated function (such as a power-law decay) best fits empirical data en.wikipedia.org en.wikipedia.org . For learners, an intuitive takeaway from the forgetting curve is the importance of timely reviews: without reinforcement, memories will decay fastest early on. Interference and Consolidation: Building on Ebbinghaus’s insights, later researchers explored why memories fail. The concept of interference became central to theories of forgetting. Proactive interference (earlier learning disrupting new learning) and retroactive interference (new learning disrupting old memories) were identified as key processes that cause forgetting beyond the mere passage of time. Jenkins and Dallenbach’s 1924 experiment, discussed above, is an elegant demonstration of retroactive interference: when awake and taking in new input, the mind overwrites or obscures existing memories, whereas during sleep (with minimal new input) memory traces are better preserved link.springer.com . This finding hinted at the process of memory consolidation – the idea that recently formed memories gradually strengthen and become more stable (often thought to occur during sleep). Later research in physiological psychology confirmed that sleep has beneficial effects on memory consolidation at the neural level (e.g. through replay of learning during slow-wave sleep), complementing the cognitive account that sleep mainly shields against interference. Overall, a key principle is that not all forgetting is due to time; much forgetting is due to interactions between memories. This has practical implications: spacing out learning (as we will see) can reduce interference between items, and ensuring periods of rest (or sleep) after intense learning can improve retention link.springer.com . Spacing Effect and Distributed Practice: One of the most robust findings in cognitive psychology of learning is the spacing effect – the benefit of distributing study or practice sessions over time, rather than cramming in a single session. Interestingly, Ebbinghaus himself observed a precursor of the spacing effect. In one anecdotal report, Ebbinghaus noted that after “cramming” repetitions of a list in one day he could recall it, but achieving similar recall with practice spread over three days required only about half as many total repetitions research.duolingo.com . In other words, spaced practice was more efficient than massed practice. Subsequent research over the past century has thoroughly documented that spaced repetition leads to better long-term retention compared to massed learning (i.e. studying the same total amount in one lump). A comprehensive review by Cepeda et al. (2006) examined hundreds of studies and confirmed that spacing effects are reliable across a wide range of materials and contexts laplab.ucsd.edu laplab.ucsd.edu . Spacing improves memory for simple verbal facts, textbook material, motor skills, and more – it appears to be a general principle of learning. The size of the benefit is often substantial. For example, one experiment found that properly spacing study sessions nearly doubled the amount of information retained after a one-year delay, compared to a massed practice condition (same total study time) escholarship.org . This dramatic improvement occurs because spaced sessions allow some forgetting to happen between sessions, which actually forces more powerful relearning. Each time you retrieve or restudy the material after a delay, the memory trace is strengthened more than if you had restudied it immediately. In effect, spaced practice exploits the forgetting curve by scheduling reviews at the point when some forgetting has occurred but not too much – a strategy often summarized as reviewing “right before you would have forgotten.” Psychologists also describe a related finding, the lag effect, which indicates that spacing is even more effective when the intervals between study sessions gradually increase (for instance, first review after 1 day, next after 3 days, then 1 week, etc.) research.duolingo.com . This helps match the schedule to the slowing pace of forgetting as retention improves. Importantly, spacing benefits are not limited to rote memorization. Studies have shown improved learning of concepts and problem-solving skills under spaced practice, and field experiments have demonstrated that spacing can boost learning in real classroom settings escholarship.org . In one classroom study, spaced review led to higher test scores on a semester-end exam than a massed review schedule home.cs.colorado.edu home.cs.colorado.edu . The universality of the spacing effect has led researchers to conclude it is a “desirable difficulty” – a learning strategy that feels more challenging (because some forgetting happens between sessions) but yields superior long-term results (Bjork, 1994). Retrieval Practice: Another principle often intertwined with spacing is the benefit of retrieval practice – actively recalling information (testing oneself) is more effective for memory than simply re-reading the material. While not the central focus of this review, it’s worth noting that much of the power of spaced repetition comes from the combination of spacing and retrieval. When learners practice retrieving information at spaced intervals, they harness two potent effects: the spacing effect and the testing effect. Research in cognitive psychology has articulated that a successful recall from memory solidifies knowledge more than passive exposure does files.eric.ed.gov . Moreover, recalling an item after some delay (when it’s a bit difficult to remember) has a bigger impact on retention than recalling it immediately after study files.eric.ed.gov . These findings underpin modern spaced repetition techniques, which typically involve attempting to retrieve the answer (as in flashcard quizzes) rather than simply reviewing the information. In summary, the key findings from over a century of research can be distilled into a few general principles: memory retention improves with appropriately spaced reviews; forgetting is mitigated when learning is spaced and when interference is minimized; and active retrieval of knowledge strongly reinforces memory. These insights have paved the way for practical methods to enhance learning. Cognitive Models of Memory and Optimal Scheduling: Beyond empirical findings, cognitive psychologists have developed theoretical models to explain learning and forgetting, and to predict the optimal timing of review. For instance, the ACT-R cognitive architecture (Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational) includes a mathematical formula for memory decay where each exposure adds to an item’s “activation” but that activation diminishes as a power function of time. Such models can capture phenomena like the spacing effect by adjusting activation based on practice history. A more recent advancement is the development of data-driven models that personalize spacing schedules for individual learners. Mozer and Lindsey’s DASH model is one prominent example. “DASH” stands for Difficulty, Ability, and Study History, reflecting the key factors the model takes into account home.cs.colorado.edu . In a 2014 study, Lindsey, Mozer and colleagues tested a personalized spacing algorithm based on a memory model in a real classroom (a semester-long Spanish course) home.cs.colorado.edu home.cs.colorado.edu . Students used a computer-based flashcard system for vocabulary practice throughout the term. The researchers compared different scheduling algorithms and found that the personalized, model-driven spacing schedule (DASH) produced the highest end-of-semester exam scores, especially for material learned early in the course home.cs.colorado.edu home.cs.colorado.edu . The DASH algorithm works by estimating how well each student knows each item and how quickly that item will be forgotten, based on past study history and item difficulty home.cs.colorado.edu . In essence, it uses a cognitive model of the forgetting curve for each item and each learner, then schedules reviews at the optimal time (just as the item is predicted to be on the verge of being forgotten). Mozer and Lindsey (2017) further elaborated this approach, emphasizing that integrating cognitive theory with “big data” from educational technology can greatly improve learning outcomes home.cs.colorado.edu home.cs.colorado.edu . They demonstrated that a theory-informed model like DASH could outperform generic one-size-fits-all spacing strategies. Simulations and experiments showed that taking into account individual differences in learning and forgetting led to more effective review schedules home.cs.colorado.edu . For example, one student might need to see a particular vocabulary word five times with increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 3 weeks, etc.), whereas another student might need fewer or more repetitions at different intervals, depending on how quickly they tend to forget that word. The model’s job is to tailor the schedule optimally. The success of DASH and similar models illustrates a general principle: optimal learning schedules should be adaptive. By using cognitive principles (like the forgetting curve and spacing effect) in a quantitative way, these models guide the timing of study to maximize retention. This line of research merges cognitive psychology with computational methods and forms the bridge to real-world applications in educational technology, such as intelligent tutoring systems and language learning apps. 6.5.1 Applications in Language Learning The principles of learning and memory described above have found practical application in many domains, but perhaps one of the most visible in everyday life is language learning. Mastering a new language requires acquiring a large amount of vocabulary and grammatical knowledge – a clear case where effective memory retention is crucial. It is no surprise that many language learning methods and apps explicitly incorporate cognitive psychology findings like spaced repetition to help users remember foreign words and phrases. Here we review how these principles are applied in language learning and assess their effectiveness from an academic standpoint. Spaced Repetition in Vocabulary Acquisition: Vocabulary learning has benefited greatly from spaced repetition techniques. Traditional flashcards have long been used by learners to drill word meanings; with the advent of computers and smartphones, flashcard programs can schedule reviews optimally using algorithms based on the spacing effect. One fundamental idea is that each word should be reviewed at increasing intervals – shortly after first learning it, then a bit later, then perhaps a day or two after, then a week, and so on. This schedule aligns with the psychological finding that an “expanding” review interval helps solidify memory (the lag effect) research.duolingo.com . Modern spaced repetition software, such as the popular Anki or Memrise platforms, implement this by tracking each item’s review history and success, and dynamically adjusting when it will next appear. For example, if you easily recall a word, the system might schedule the next review farther out; if you struggle or forget, the system will show it again sooner. This approach is a direct translation of the difficulty-sensitive spacing principle discussed earlier (and indeed echoes the DASH model’s focus on item difficulty and individual performance). Academic research strongly supports the effectiveness of such approaches for language learning. In a controlled study, Chukharev-Hudilainen and Klepikova (2016) tested a computer-based spaced repetition tool for English vocabulary training among foreign language learners. Over the course of a semester, students who used the tool for just a few minutes each day achieved significantly better long-term retention of the vocabulary than those who did not files.eric.ed.gov . In fact, the spaced repetition group’s vocabulary retention after a delay was roughly three times higher than that of the control group, despite the minimal daily time investment files.eric.ed.gov . This three-fold improvement is striking evidence that incorporating spacing into study can greatly enhance learning efficiency. Other studies have similarly found that spaced presentation of new words yields better memory than massed presentation. Classic research by Bahrick et al. (1993) showed that spreading foreign language word practice sessions across intervals as long as 56 days produced superior retention over a 5-year period, compared to shorter interval practice or cramming laplab.ucsd.edu . The benefits of spacing are thus seen not only in short laboratory tests but in longitudinal retention of language knowledge. Language Learning Apps and Cognitive Principles: Popular language-learning applications like Duolingo, Babbel, and Memrise have brought these cognitive principles to millions of users. Duolingo, for instance, uses a gamified approach to teach languages, but behind the scenes it employs algorithms influenced by spaced repetition and learning curve models. The Duolingo research team developed a statistical model called “Half-Life Regression” (Settles &amp; Meeder, 2016) to predict how long a learner will remember a word or grammar concept and when they will need to review it research.duolingo.com research.duolingo.com . The model’s name is inspired by the idea of a memory “half-life” – the time it takes for the probability of recalling an item to fall to 50%. By analyzing the huge amount of data from its user base, Duolingo’s system can continuously adjust practice schedules for each learner. Empirical evaluation of this system showed tangible improvements: the half-life regression model was able to predict users’ recall accuracy much better (reducing prediction error by over 45% compared to simpler baselines) and, when deployed, it led to a 12% increase in user engagement with daily practice research.duolingo.com research.duolingo.com . The increased engagement likely results from users experiencing a manageable level of difficulty – not too easy (which can be boring) and not too hard (which can be discouraging) – by reviewing items at the right time. From an effectiveness standpoint, more engagement means more practice and thus better learning outcomes, a contention supported by the finding that those on optimized schedules retain more and stick with the program longer. Another app, Memrise, uses a similar spaced repetition strategy and often incorporates mnemonic aids. Babbel’s curriculum explicitly staggers review sessions for previously learned vocabulary at expanding intervals to reinforce retention. Overall, these apps are effectively applied cognitive psychology tools. They implement the spacing effect, interleaved practice, and sometimes retrieval practice (since users must actively recall translations) to maximize learning per unit time. Effectiveness and Academic Assessments: Do these approaches actually work in practice? Research so far indicates yes – when used properly, spaced repetition-based language learning can be highly effective. Learners can achieve substantial vocabulary gains through self-guided app practice. Studies comparing app-based learning to classroom instruction have found that dedicated app users can learn a volume of material in a few months that is comparable to one or two semesters of language class instruction. For example, an early independent study on Duolingo by Vesselinov and Grego (2012) estimated that 34 hours of Duolingo practice were equivalent to a semester of college language education in terms of reading and writing outcomes (though speaking skills were not as directly taught). From a cognitive perspective, this efficiency makes sense: the apps force learners to practice frequently, recall actively, and review content right as they are about to forget it – all conditions known to solidify memory. Another scholarly evaluation (Graham, 2019) of Babbel found that users who completed a certain number of lessons showed significantly better retention of new vocabulary than a control group on a delayed post-test, confirming that the spaced review in the app had positive effects. While user motivation and consistency are variable (one challenge is that many learners do not stick with the app long-term), those who do engage benefit from the well-designed schedules. It is worth noting that these apps often combine spaced repetition with other pedagogical features, so isolating the exact contribution of spacing sometimes requires careful experimental design. However, given the overwhelming laboratory evidence for spacing, it stands to reason that much of the success of such apps lies in their timing of practice. Researchers have also begun to use data from these apps to further refine our understanding of learning. For instance, large-scale analyses from Duolingo’s database have provided new insights into which types of words are harder to remember and how factors like the learner’s native language or the similarity between languages affect retention. This feedback loop between cognitive science and educational technology exemplifies how applications of learning principles can both utilize and inform scientific knowledge. In summary, the core cognitive principles of effective learning – spaced practice, repeated retrieval, and attention to interference – are actively leveraged in modern language learning approaches. Spaced repetition, in particular, is a common thread in successful programs. Academic assessments generally support the effectiveness of these methods: they tend to improve long-term retention of language material significantly compared to massed learning or unguided study. The integration of cognitive psychology into app design has made scientifically grounded learning tools widely accessible to the general population, enabling people to benefit from techniques like spacing without needing to plan the schedules themselves. As a result, language learners today can take advantage of algorithms that schedule their practice for optimal memory retention, a direct real-world application of over a century of memory research. Conclusion Understanding the general principles of learning and memory has been a central quest in cognitive psychology, from the early experiments of Ebbinghaus to the sophisticated computational models of today. This literature review has highlighted several key concepts: the predictable shape of forgetting and learning curves, the crucial influence of factors like interference and repetition on memory retention, and the immense benefits of spaced practice for durable learning. Foundational studies provided simple but powerful lessons – memory fades quickly without reinforcement, and the context of learning (such as being asleep or awake, or spacing out practice) can dramatically change how much we retain. Building on those insights, modern researchers have developed strategies and models (e.g., the DASH model of Mozer &amp; Lindsey) to optimize learning by tailoring review schedules to the learner’s needs. These advances are not only theoretical; they have been translated into practice in educational technology. Language learning, a field heavily dependent on memorization, has been a prime beneficiary of this translational research. Techniques like spaced repetition and adaptive recall practice, grounded in cognitive theory, demonstrably improve language learners’ outcomes, making the process more efficient and effective files.eric.ed.gov research.duolingo.com . In essence, cognitive psychology has revealed that learning is not just about how much time we spend or how motivated we are, but also when and how we study. Timing matters: reviewing information at strategically spaced intervals can cement knowledge in a way that marathon cramming never can. Method matters: actively recalling and engaging with the material strengthens memory more than passive exposure. These general principles apply broadly – whether one is trying to remember a list of words, understand a scientific concept, or practice a musical instrument. By applying these principles, educators and learners can significantly boost memory performance. The success of spaced repetition in both lab and real-world settings underscores a hopeful message: forgetting is natural, but it is not inevitable – with the right techniques, we can greatly extend the longevity of our memories. Looking ahead, the synergy between cognitive research and educational application is likely to grow. As we collect more data from learning apps and classroom interventions, our models of memory will become more refined, and in turn those models will power more effective learning tools. This ongoing dialogue between theory and practice was anticipated by pioneers like Ebbinghaus, who sought general laws of memory, and it continues in contemporary efforts to personalize and optimize learning. For the general population, the takeaway is clear: strategies based on cognitive psychology (like spacing your study, self-testing, and giving yourself time to forget and relearn) can make a tremendous difference in how well you learn and remember. Harnessing these principles can turn the ebbing tides of forgetting into lasting knowledge. In conclusion, the marriage of time-tested cognitive principles with modern technology offers an exciting path forward to help people learn better and remember longer – fulfilling, in a very practical way, the early psychologists’ quest to understand and improve human memory.

Thus, a first step in this thesis is to propose a theoretical model, which can then later be formulated more precisely as a computational model, then tested, partly with data collected throughout this thesis. However, related computational models have been described, for instance in the domain of aural skill acquisition (Baker 2019) and sung melodic recall by the author (Silas and Müllensiefen 2023; Silas, Müllensiefen, and Kopiez 2023). Theoretical cognitive models have also been described in the domain of singing accuracy (Pfordresher et al. 2015). Therefore, in this section, I will attempt to synthesise this literature to propose a corresponding model specifically for playing by ear skills. I distinguish between two basic playing by ear processes: a) playing by ear skill acquisition (learning) and b) playing by ear skill execution (recall). 7.1 Pfordresher’s H-PAC model 7.2 Pfordresher’s cognitive model of singing accuracy I start first by using Pfordresher et al. (2015)’s cognitive (but non-computational) model of singing accuracy, which is the most broad of the models I will review. At the low level, this model comprises an auditory feedback loop. In this loop, first, external auditory input is processed as low-level perceptual representations of sound (pitch, duration, timbre, loudness). Such low-level representations are used as input to a translation model, which relates auditory input to sensorimotor action that is relevant to singing. Hence, this enables the guidance of a singer’s sensorimotor plans to adjust their singing (e.g., to be in tune), in response to auditory feedback. Such changes in sensorimotor actions comprise physical processes like respiration, phonation, and articulation. Abstracting the sensorimotor part to the domain of playing by ear, such physical processes would be somewhat instrument-specific. For many instruments, the physical part will involve finger coordination (e.g., clarinet, violin), but for some, coordination will be more at the level of the arm (e.g., percussion, drums). Many processes will be instrument-specific processes. For example, for brass and woodwind instruments, requiring to coordinate an embouchure to produce a sound. We do not exhaust these instrument-specific processes, but only state that such physical processes are part of the model, with instrument-specific attributes. The lower-level auditory representations are also used as input to higher levels of cognition, which hold mental templates about music (e.g., its features, such as its tonality), stored in long- term memory (Baddeley et al., 2009). These templates allow auditory content to be categorized, forming more sophisticated representations of it, taking on musical domains such as representations of (melodic) features like tonality and contour, as well as segmenting melodies into coherent perceptual chunks. These formed higher-level representations can in turn be used as input back to the lower-level auditory feedback loop and further inform sensorimotor planning. Hence, the overall architecture of Pfordresher et al. (2015)’s cognitive model is bidirectional: both “top down” and “bottom up”. Altogether, this system enables a singer - to fulfill objectives related to sung recall (i.e., hearing stimuli, representing its musical features mentally, responding through singing, and adjusting behavior to fulfill the goal sufficiently). This can readily be abstracted to playing by ear too: the only difference being in the motor plan aspects, which, as mentioned, are instrument-specific. Our focus in the current manuscript is on the higher-level aspects of this model: memory for melodic representations. Caption for the image 7.3 Baker’s computational model of melodic dictation 7.4 Models of sung recall Lastly, I synthesise models from my own research regarding sung melodic recall. My Silas, Müllensiefen, and Kopiez (2023) study investigated sung recall by examining its relationship with other related skills and participant attributes. Demographically, better sung recall ability ability was associated with more musical training (𝛽 = 0.07), a younger age (𝛽 = -0.05), and being female (𝛽 = -0.03), though the latter two effects were small. The findings suggest that while musical training can enhance singing ability, inherent skills might also predispose individuals to seek musical training. Moreover, there was a relatively large difference between the marginal and conditional R^2 values, which suggests that there is a sizeable proportion of individual differences in the sample of participants tested which explains SAA performance which shows that individual differences should explain performance on a task in which one can develop high levels of domain-specific expertise. We found there that melodic discrimination, pitch imagery abilities, and mistuning perception appear to be fundamental skills contributing to melodic sung recall. The sung recall score we devised moderately correlated with self-reported singing ability (r = .46) and musical training (r = ?). However, it shows no significant correlation with visuospatial working memory or pitch discrimination, aligning with previous research and suggesting that singing ability is not closely linked to low-level perceptual processes. This suggests that, whilst The study also shows that melodic features which indicate melodic complexity (including melody length) are relevant predictors of sung recall performance. These predictors represented melody length, as well as features related to contour, tonality, statistical occurrence of N-grams in the melody, and durational complexity. Rhythmic trials were generally found to be more difficult (B = -0.15, p &lt; .001) and we found that it was appropriate to create separate models for arhythmic and rhythmic. In another of my papers, (Silas and Müllensiefen 2023), we investigated how individuals learn and recall melodies using a computational approach that emphasizes similarity metrics rather than traditional accuracy-based methods. The research involved 31 participants who sang back 28 melodies presented either as piano sounds or vocal audio excerpts from pop songs, with each melody repeated up to six times. The similarity between the target melody and the participants’ sung recalls was measured using advanced algorithmic techniques. The primary goal was to understand how melodic recall improves over successive attempts and what factors most significantly influence recall accuracy. One of the key findings of the study is that the length of sung recall attempts consistently increases across multiple attempts, and this increase significantly correlates with the overall similarity to the target melody. This observation challenges the traditional view that musical features such as interval patterns or tonality are the primary factors influencing melodic recall. Instead, the study suggests that the sheer length of the melody plays a more critical role, indicating that general memory constraints may be more influential than music-specific features. This insight aligns with theories of working memory, suggesting that melodic recall shares characteristics with other types of serial recall rather than being purely domain-specific to music. A significant finding (presented there in Figure 8), examines how similarity changes as a function of attempt and the specific section of the melody (beginning, middle, end). The results show that similarity performance increases more rapidly for the beginning of the melody compared to the middle and end across successive attempts. This indicates that participants tend to stabilise their recall of the initial melodic segments earlier than the middle or end sections. The end sections, in particular, show a slower rate of improvement, suggesting that the latter parts of a melody are more challenging to accurately recall perhaps due to the higher working memory load as a result of having to remember more notes, the later you are in a position, or that generally people engaging in sung recall prioritise getting the earlier parts melody correct first. This finding supports the theory that memory encoding is stronger for the beginning of sequences, a phenomenon consistent with the primacy effect observed in other types of serial recall tasks. It also highlights that recall accuracy is not uniformly distributed across a melody, with the initial segments being more robustly learned compared to later ones. The study also found that musical training did not significantly enhance recall performance when similarity metrics were used as the primary assessment method, as shown in another key result. This challenges the conventional belief that formal musical training substantially improves melodic recall ability. Instead, the data suggests that domain-general memory skills may be just as important, pointing to a more integrative understanding of how musical and non-musical cognitive processes interact. Moreover, the results highlight that similarity scores increase with each successive attempt, but the rate of improvement diminishes after the third or fourth attempt. This pattern suggests that the most substantial gains in melodic recall occur early in the learning process, followed by incremental refinements in pitch and rhythm accuracy. Additionally, melodies presented as vocal audio excerpts resulted in higher recall accuracy compared to piano sound presentations, indicating that the human voice might provide additional mnemonic cues that aid in memory encoding. Overall, the study’s use of similarity-based metrics, particularly the “opti3” metric that integrates pitch intervals, harmonic progression, and rhythmic similarity, offers a more nuanced and accurate assessment of how melodies are learned and recalled. By focusing on the gradual increase in recall length and the differential improvement across melodic segments, the study sheds light on the underlying cognitive processes involved in melodic memory, emphasizing the role of general memory mechanisms and the relatively limited impact of formal musical training. 7.5 Non-musical models of serial recall (look at Silas &amp; Müllensiefen paper) ACT-R 7.6 WM bits Baddeley and hitch Berz (1995) LTWM (erricsson) Silas et al. (2022) discussion around MWM and GWM 7.7 Bringing it together In sum, then, 7.8 Moving from Theoretical to Computational “When we develop a psychological theory that is sufficiently precise to be implemented as a computer program, we call it a computational model. The process of developing such theories, and implementing their corresponding computer programs, is then called computational modelling.” (Harrison 2025). At this point, I already suggest a more specific feature to the model: that for playing by ear tasks, there exists a mental melodic “similarity” algorithm, housed in working memory. The input to this module is the target melody and the evolving real-time assessment of the melody being produced in the moment. The performer must hear the target melody, store this in short term memory as a reference, and then continuously update the target melody which each new note that is produced. I speculate that the mind recomputes the similarity between the presently number of recalled notes and the target melody iteratively, each time a new note is added. In other words, a check for the accuracy is made every time a note is recalled, and the presence of an error and its nature, will inform whether or not the performer stops to start again or continues to proceed recalling the melody, at least in the stage of learning. Formally: 7.8.1 Inputs \\(T = [t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_n]\\): TargetMelody of fixed length \\(n\\). \\(R = [r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_k]\\): RecalledMelody of length \\(k\\), unknown a priori. 7.8.2 Sequential Construction \\(T\\) is fixed and built one note at a time. \\(R\\) is sequentially constructed one note at a time. 7.8.3 Function Application At each step \\(i\\) (current length of \\(R\\)), the function MelSim is applied to TargetMelody and the current length of RecalledMelody. 7.9 Mathematical Representation Let: - \\(T_i\\) be the prefix of the TargetMelody up to length \\(i\\), i.e., \\(T_i = [t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_i]\\). - \\(R_i\\) be the current state of the RecalledMelody of length \\(i\\), i.e., \\(R_i = [r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_i]\\). - \\(\\text{MelSim}(T_i, R_i)\\) be the similarity function between the two melodies at length \\(i\\). The MelSim function can be formulated as: \\[ \\text{MelSim}(T_i, R_i) = f(T_i, R_i) \\] Where: - \\(f\\) is a similarity measure (e.g., distance function, alignment score). - \\(i\\) iterates from 1 to \\(n\\), where \\(n\\) is the fixed length of the target melody. 7.10 Algorithm Flow Start with an empty recalled melody \\(R\\). For each new note \\(r_i\\) added to \\(R\\): Compute the similarity: \\(\\text{MelSim}(T_i, R_i)\\) if \\(i = n\\). Repeat until the entire recalled melody is constructed. 7.11 Final Equation The similarity calculation is performed only when the length of the RecalledMelody equals the fixed length of the TargetMelody. Therefore, the final equation is expressed as: \\[ \\text{MelSim}(T, R_n) = f(T, R_n) \\] I note that the MelSim algorithm is itself modular and of discussion in and of itself (cite M&amp;F).

Whilst many musicological and psychological tools exist, as far as I am aware, there is no open source academic framework that provides an end-to-end solution for recording produced musical data, transcribing audio into useful symbolic representations, and assessing these representations within a scientific statistical modelling framework - all in real-time. However, it would be far beyond the scope of any individual to produce all the required components, themselves requiring considerable research. Indeed, we stand on the shoulders of giants. In that respect, my work here has mainly been to find ways to combine the already existing tools into a framework - to get them to interact with one another - and create useful data structures to store relevant information and make it readily usable in web applications. To not detract from the theoretical questions in this manuscript, I will only give a brief tour of this architecture here. However, please see the documentation for a more thorough treatment. I will start with the low-level packages and work my way up to the higher level ones. 8.1 pyin: To be able to assess music production data, it is first necessary to melsim 8.2 Psychologically meaningful musical item banks: itembankr In my literature review, I noted that pattern books and melodic repositories have emerged to support jazz improvisation and acquiring inner melodic representations. Such books present itemised melodic patterns to stimulate compositional ideas or so that training musicians can practise acquiring cognitive representations of new melodic material (Lateef, 2015; Weiskopf, 2015; Slonimsky, 1947; Ricker, 1999). Such books are essentially corpora or item banks of melodic grammar and possibilities. As well as improving one’s melodic “vocabulary”, such books can be used to develop technical prowess, by challenging the player to acquire new action patterns to perform the items. However, often these volumes are just repositories of melodies and lack a systematic structure, or if they do, the structure is not built upon robust cognitive psychological principles tha can advance the objective of efficient learning. This is also a technological issue: moreover, books are static and not able to break down items into smaller pieces and consider the relationship between items. By not being structured in a way that makes them optimised for memorisation, such books are limited. Typically, contents will be structured into discrete items where each item represents a particular melodic sequence. However, each of these items can be broken into smaller contiguous subsets known as N-grams (Damashek, 1995) or “chunks”. Such componentisation makes items more readily memorable since sequence length is a major predictor of how memorable an item is (Cowan, 2010; Miller, 1956). The implication is that, by first learning smaller chunks and then increasing the size of chunks, one can optimise the learning process (Lehmann &amp; Kopiez, 2011). To undertake such a task manually is more or less impossible as it would require an individual to comprehend a combinatorial explosion of relationships between the items in a given corpus (intra-corpus). Moreover, different corpora will also share identical and similar chunks, so learning one chunk may support learning other chunks inter-corpuses too. It would be redundant to treat these as separate chunks (except to count chunks by frequency, another potential indicator of its usefulness) and would instead be more efficient to have a centralised system which can consider information inter-corpora. The purpose of itembankr is to.. The present paper details a new set of scripts which allow a user to process a corpus programmatically to solve some of the problems above. Consequentially, it is able to: a) provide useful insights into that particular corpus b) process the corpus into more readily memorable structures c) facilitate the ability to relate items to one another intra-corpus and inter-corpus . In doing so, the application should be able to improve the amount of time a user requires to learn melodic information from repositories of patterns. itembankr gives a more useful representation to such melodic representations. library(itembankr) library(WJD) library(Berkowitz) #library(Slonimsky) 8.3 Datasets 8.3.1 WJD The command used to create the item bank was: WJD &lt;- corpus_to_item_bank(corpus_name = &quot;WJD&quot;, corpus_df = phrases_dbs2, output_type = &quot;ngram&quot;, phrases_db = phrases_dbs2, launch_app = FALSE) The properties of the item bank are: WJD::WJD itembankr::hist_item_bank(WJD::WJD) 8.3.2 Berkowitz head(Berkowitz::Berkowitz) itembankr::hist_item_bank(Berkowitz::Berkowitz) 8.3.3 Slonimsky head(Slonimsky::Slonimsky) itembankr::hist_item_bank(Slonimsky::Slonimsky) 8.4 Other useful functions itembankr::subset_item_bank() itembankexplorer::item_bank_explorer(Berkowitz::Berkowitz) Much of the architecture is grouped under the musicassessr package and ecosystem (silasMusicassessrEcosystemRecord2023?). musicassessr is, in essence, a giant wrapper, bringing already developed psychological and musicological into the same software environment, backed by a statistical modelling framework in R (R Core Team 2020). 8.4.1 Assessing musical behaviours: musicassessr library(musicassessr) library(htmltools) htmltools::tagList( lapply(musicassessr::musicassessr_js(visual_notation = TRUE), function(x) { if(base::startsWith(x, &quot;http&quot;)) { htmltools::tags$script(src = x) } else { htmltools::includeScript(x) } }) ) musicassessr::present_stimuli( stimuli = c(60, 62, 64, 65), stimuli_type = &quot;midi_notes&quot;, display_modality = &quot;visual&quot; ) 8.5 Ability tests 8.6 Conclusion Thus, a primary outcome of this dissertation was the development of a computational ecosystem to record and assess music production data in real-time.

Then you allow the participant to listen back to their attempt and rate the similarity (like the paradigm I implemented for the Edoardo study). Hence, you get three data points (or more if you have multiple attempts) for each trial/stimulus: i) a production score, ii) an evaluation from memory/confidence score, iii) a perceptual score. The similarity score can also have a condition to it where we either present the participant’s produced recall back as audio or the MIDI transcription produced on-the-fly. Could be a very informative. And just to add, this is closely related to real music learning processes whereby you can imagine musicians undergoing some process like this in the practice room: recall, reflect, revise.. That’s a great idea! Maybe we should call this the production-reflection-perception paradigm. This could work with melodies but also individual tones (long notes) or rhythms, or even sections of rehearsed pieces. It might be useful as an individual differences test (also testing reflective and perceptual self-assessment abilities) and it could be useful as a general learning paradigm. Maybe this is something for the Diaes4all project to try out? Alternatively / additionally, we could suggest this as an MMB student project for the next year.
