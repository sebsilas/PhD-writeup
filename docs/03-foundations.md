# What is playing by ear?

In this dissertation, I define playing by ear as the ability to reproduce an aurally presented melody on and instrument (including the voice). To play well by ear means to reproduce the musical properties of the heard melody accurately across relevant domains, such as pitch, interval and rhythmic structures. I note, that, precisely what these important musical structures to assess accuracy by are consist of is non-trivial, and something partly explored on this thesis. I thus leave the definition relatively general at this point. To play badly by ear means to struggle to reproduce the musical structures contained in the melody.

Note, that my definition separates playing by ear from "improvisation", which is about spontaneously generating (new) ideas, not a faithful replication of that heard before.

## Learning to play by ear

I separate the general process of "playing by ear" from "learning to play by ear", even though the two are intrinsically linked. "Playing by ear" presumes that the melody is sufficiently "prelearned" to be recalled almost perfectly. Conversely, learning to play by ear is a separate process, whereby the melody to be recalled is not yet stable enough in memory to be reproduced faithfully. It will take specifically at least more than one attempt to be recalled accurately - potentially "revised" - or may not be recallable in a given session. Thus, learning requires multiple attempts. Learning also requires that improvements are made over attempts, in the relative short term [@silasLearningRecallingMelodies2023], but also over longer time periods.
