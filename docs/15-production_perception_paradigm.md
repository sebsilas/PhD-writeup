# Production perception paradigm {#production_perception}



You ask participants to recall a melody, followed by a confidence rating about how well they did it. Then you allow the participant to listen back to their attempt and rate the similarity (like the paradigm I implemented for the Edoardo study).

Hence, you get three data points (or more if you have multiple attempts) for each trial/stimulus: i) a production score, ii) an evaluation from memory/confidence score, iii) a perceptual score.

The similarity score can also have a condition to it where we either present the participant’s produced recall back as audio or the MIDI transcription produced on-the-fly.

Could be a very informative.

And just to add, this is closely related to real music learning processes whereby you can imagine musicians undergoing some process like this in the practice room: recall, reflect, revise..

That’s a great idea!
Maybe we should call this the production-reflection-perception paradigm.
This could work with melodies but also individual tones (long notes) or rhythms, or even sections of rehearsed pieces.
 
It might be useful as an individual differences test (also testing reflective and perceptual self-assessment abilities) and it could be useful as a general learning paradigm.
Maybe this is something for the Diaes4all project to try out?
 
Alternatively / additionally, we could suggest this as an MMB student project for the next year.
 
Thanks for sharing and all the best,
