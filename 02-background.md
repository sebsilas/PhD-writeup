First, I will motivate my discussion of learning to play by ear with some historical context around the traditional methods that have been used, particularly with in the context of learning to play jazz music. Then, I will largely leave this historical context behind and motivate the question from systematic musicological and cognitive psychological points of view, where the remainder of this manuscript will largely remain.


## Historical Approaches to Improving Playing by Ear in Jazz Pedagogy

Jazz music began as an aural tradition where skills were developed through listening and imitation rather than formal instruction. The development of aural skills—often described as "playing by ear"—has been a central feature of jazz learning, especially throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In this section, I describe the historical evolution of approaches to developing aural skills in jazz education, from early reliance on recordings to modern technological methods. I survey how record players, transcription books, and pattern books have supported the ear training process in jazz education and the evolving interplay between informal, aural traditions and formalised, institutional methods. This suggests a gradual shift from purely aural learning to increasingly systematised approaches, reflecting broader trends in the institutionalization of jazz education. Despite this evolution, the fundamental importance of developing acute listening skills remains central to effective jazz pedagogy.

## The Aural Origins of Jazz Education

The early history of jazz was characterised by learning that occurred primarily through aural means. As @herzig2019abc notes, this involved "hours of listening, transcribing, and participating in jam sessions" before formal educational approaches emerged. In this pre-institutional era, the transmission of jazz knowledge occurred organically within communities of practice, with experienced musicians serving as mentors to aspiring players. This master-apprentice relationship formed the foundation of early jazz pedagogy, where direct demonstration and immediate repetition were the primary teaching methods. The absence of formal jazz education in the early period necessitated this aural approach, as musicians needed to develop their skills through direct engagement with the music itself. While some things were written down, such as Downbeat transcriptions in the 1940's [@kogerFiftyYearsBeat1985], the vast majority of what people learned and played was done by ear. This established a precedent that would continue to influence jazz pedagogy even as more formalised approaches developed. The emphasis on learning by ear ensured that early jazz musicians developed strong aural skills as a natural consequence of their training process.

## Record Players as Pedagogical Tools

The development of recording technology dramatically transformed jazz education by making the music of master performers accessible to aspiring musicians regardless of geographic location. Acevedo notes in his dissertation that recordings became essential educational resources, allowing students to study the repertoire and improvisations of established artists. This technological advancement democratized access to jazz education, extending learning opportunities beyond those who could physically attend performances or study with established musicians. @re2004role notes that technologies such as variable-speed turntables and digital audio software enabled closer analysis, allowing students to slow down recordings for detailed ear training. Listening was an active engagement: learners would loop short segments, replicate phrases, and match articulation.

The ability to repeatedly listen to recorded performances proved particularly valuable, especially since records could be "endlessly repeated" [@surberRecordProgressionsTechnology2009]. This repetition allowed students to internalize not only melodies and chord progressions but also nuances of style, tone, and expression that were difficult to communicate through written notation. The practice of slowing down recordings or lifting the needle to replay difficult passages became standard pedagogical techniques that allowed for deep analysis of complex musical passages.

The phonograph was an indispensable tool for jazz learners. Listening to records enabled musicians to internalize jazz language and style. @berliner1994thinking emphasizes that imitation from recordings helped players build a mental library of harmonic and melodic ideas, forming a foundation for improvisation. Even as jazz moved into universities, listening retained primacy. @wilf2012rituals describes rituals within jazz education that centered around repeated listening to canonical recordings—practices that continued to uphold the oral-aural traditions at the heart of jazz pedagogy.


## Codification of Jazz Education


The transition from purely aural learning to more systematized approaches began in the mid-20th century. @herzig2019abc identifies the 1930s as a pivotal period, with early attempts to codify jazz instruction including Norbert Bleihoof's "Modern Arranging and Orchestration" (1935) and Lee Bowden's training program for Afro-American Service Musicians at the Great Lakes Naval Base (1942-45). These initial efforts to systematize jazz education represented the beginning of a shift toward more formalized instructional approaches, though they remained relatively limited in scope.

Transcribing solos has historically been a core method of ear training in jazz. Berliner (1994) and Re (2004) argue that the act of transcribing by ear strengthens aural recognition and improvisational understanding. However, the rise of printed transcription books—like the *Charlie Parker Omnibook*—introduced shifts in practice.

While these books provided accessible models for study, Witmer and Robbins (1988) found that many early transcription collections failed to support active listening. The danger, they argue, lies in students relying on notation rather than using their ears.

Academic consensus (Re 2004; Berliner 1994) supports transcription as most effective when used in tandem with active listening—students should first attempt to transcribe by ear and then use notated versions for verification or analysis.

A watershed moment in jazz education came in the late 1960s, with what Herzig terms "the ABCs of jazz" - referring to the influential work of Jamey Aebersold, David Baker, and Jerry Coker. Their development of comprehensive instructional materials, including Baker's "Jazz Improvisation: a Comprehensive Method for all Players" (1969) and Aebersold's play-along recordings, established a framework for jazz education that continues to influence pedagogical approaches today. These materials helped standardize jazz instruction and made it more accessible to students without direct access to master performers, contributing to what Prouty describes as the "wholesale growth" of jazz education during the 1960s and 70s.


## The Chord-Scale Approach, Pattern Books and Vocabulary Acquisition


The chord-scale approach pioneered by Baker, Aebersold, and Coker became a dominant paradigm in jazz education. As Spice notes in his literature review of jazz improvisation pedagogy, these influential educators "focus on scales and modes to examine improvisation". This approach provided students with systematic frameworks for navigating harmonic structures, offering concrete tools for developing improvisational facility. The emphasis on scales and patterns created a more accessible entry point for students transitioning from classical training to jazz improvisation.

Aebersold's own description of his pedagogical evolution reveals the gradual systematization of his approach: "I published my first jazz play-a-long in 1967 and the [accompanying] booklet included concert [key] chords for each track. Subsequent printings added transposed chord symbols [for Bb and Eb instruments] and, eventually, I added the needed transposed scales and chords for each track". This approach represented a compromise between purely aural learning and more visually-oriented instructional methods, coupling "the eye with the ear" in ways that provided students with multiple pathways for internalizing jazz vocabulary. The development of pattern books and play-along recordings created standardized resources that facilitated the institutional teaching of jazz improvisation.

Pattern books, such as Coker’s *Patterns for Jazz* and Baker’s *Improvisational Patterns*, systematized jazz vocabulary through short, transposable licks and exercises. Witmer and Robbins (1988) recognize their role in helping students internalize chord-scale relationships and idiomatic phrases.

However, these tools also sparked criticism. Benward and Wildman (1984) caution that over-reliance can yield formulaic improvisation disconnected from the spontaneous, reactive nature of jazz. Wilf (2012) views pattern books as part of a broader institutional shift from oral tradition to codified curriculum.

Educators like Coker (1964) emphasized integrating these resources with listening and improvisation. Used as an ear-training aid, patterns could reinforce melodic shapes and harmonic contexts, provided students also engaged with recordings and creative application.

In more recent times, other repositories of melodies have emerged which are not usually as concerned with twelve-tone possibilities, but are more constrained to a pedagogically focused item banks. Such volumes can be viewed as melodic etudes, which are usually geared towards jazz improvisation and acquiring inner melodic representations.

In the music theory and music education literatures, particularly with respect to jazz improvisation, there are many books which contain itemised melodic patterns to stimulate compositional ideas or so that training musicians can practise acquiring cognitive representations of new melodic material  (Lateef, 2015; Weiskopf, 2015; Slonimsky, 1947; Ricker, 1999). Such books are essentially corpuses (of which they will from here be referred to) of melodic grammar and possibilities. As well as improving one’s melodic “vocabulary”, such books can be used to develop technical prowess, by challenging the player to acquire new action patterns to perform the items. 

However, often these volumes are just repositories of melodies and lack a systematic structure, or if they do, the structure is not built upon rigid principles which advance the objective of efficient learning. This is also a technological issue: books are not able to break down items into smaller pieces and consider the relationship between items. Instead, the meaning as to be discovered post hoc by the book’s user. 

Therefore, by not bring structured in a way that makes them optimised for memorisation such books are limited. Typically, contents will be structured into discrete items where each item represents a particular melodic sequence. However, each of these items can be broken into smaller contiguous subsets known as n-grams (Damashek, 1995), here called “chunks”. Such componentisation makes items more readily memorable since sequence length is a major predictor of how memorable an item is (Cowan, 2010; Miller, 1956). The implication is that, by first learning smaller chunks and then increasing the size of chunks, one can optimise the learning process (Lehmann & Kopiez, 2011). To undertake such a task manually is more or less impossible as it would require an individual to comprehend a combinatorial explosion of relationships between the items in a given corpus (intra-corpus). Moreover, different corpuses will also share identical and similar chunks, so learning one chunk may support learning other chunks inter-corpuses. It would be redundant to treat these as separate chunks (except to count chunks by frequency, another potential indicator of its usefulness) and would instead be more efficient to have a centralised system which can consider information inter-corpus. 


## The Influence of John Coltrane

John Coltrane's approach to improvisation, characterized by systematic exploration of harmonic possibilities, had a profound impact on jazz pedagogy. Research examining Coltrane's melodic vocabulary reveals his methodical approach to developing improvisational frameworks, including his systematic exploration of harmonic structures through patterns and exercises. His disciplined practice methods and innovative harmonic concepts established new paradigms for jazz improvisation that would be incorporated into educational approaches.

Coltrane's influence extended beyond his specific musical innovations to encompass his overall approach to musical development. His systematic exploration of musical possibilities demonstrated the value of structured practice and theoretical understanding alongside intuitive improvisation. Scholars have analyzed Coltrane's use of pitch-class sets and other patterns, noting the "potential influence of Nicolas Slonimsky's Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns (1947)". This connection between Coltrane's innovative improvisational approach and Slonimsky's theoretical work illustrates the emerging synthesis between systematized approaches and creative expression in jazz education.

## Slonimsky's Thesaurus and Jazz Improvisation

Nicolas Slonimsky's "Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns" represents a significant intersection between theoretical systems and jazz improvisation. Although originally conceived as a classical resource, the text became influential among jazz musicians seeking to expand their improvisational vocabulary. According to research on Coltrane's musical development, "the influence of Nicolas Slonimsky's Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns on the developing melodic vocabulary of John Coltrane was profound". This adoption of Slonimsky's work illustrates how jazz education has drawn from diverse sources beyond the jazz tradition itself.

The Thesaurus provided jazz musicians with systematic approaches to exploring melodic possibilities within the twelve-tone chromatic scale. As noted in Joe Hubbard's educational materials, the book "literally contains millions of permutations based on the equal intervallic divisions of the 12-tone chromatic scale" and was utilized by numerous influential jazz musicians including "John Coltrane, Pat Martino, Herbie Hancock, and Jaco Pastorius". The application of these patterns to jazz contexts demonstrates how theoretical systems could be adapted to serve improvisational purposes, expanding the vocabulary available to jazz improvisers while maintaining connections to the aural tradition.

In 1947, the Russian-American composer Nicolas Slonimsky who was “obsessed with twelve-tone rows” (https://books.google.de/books?id=r9S--ESUuxEC&pg=PR151&lpg=PR151&dq=schoenberg+feat+of+mental+gymnastics&source=bl&ots=V4wLBZKQPn&sig=ACfU3U2mfVWZ-_DJgE8OEHtNN-SCCS5HJA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjooqOFtcTtAhV75-AKHQqaA9EQ6AEwBHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q&f=false) produced a seminal book in music theory: the Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns (from here referred to as the Slonimsky’s Thesaurus; Slonimsky, 1947). As suggested by its title, the book is an exhaustive collection of musical melodies which Slonimsky laboriously generated manually and systematically. The purpose of such a volume was to provide a repository of musical melodies which breaks free of traditional tonal harmonic principles. In other words, it was an attempt to systematically open up possibilities in the Western Music system which had not yet been explored.

Slonimsky’s undertaking can be viewed as a way of codifying and unlocking the potential of music through systematization; it highlights that by algorithimic thinking, new possibilities can be unleashed. As such, Slonimsky’s volume fascinated.. Coltrane … Zappa.

One basic principle behind Slonimsky’s systematization was to divide one or more octaves of the twelve-tone system into symmetrical intervals and, from there, systematically interpolate different numbers of notes between the intervals created by the divisions. Additionally, he used other formulae to generate melodic patterns which had not yet been yield by his basic scheme. Of The Thesaurus, Schoenberg wrote to Slonimsky, “you might [have] in all probability organized every possible succession of tones" and referred to his work as "an admirable feast of mental gymnastics”. Whilst the former is almost certainly not true (unless constrained to a length, the possibilities of melodies are infinite), the latter is undoubtedly. However, such a task would now be solved at ease by a script on a modern computer.

=> Coltrane's use represents a desire to move from simply "learning the oral tradition" to developing new melodic ideas.

## Modern Technological Approaches to Ear Training

Contemporary approaches to ear training have leveraged technological advancements to create new pedagogical tools. The development of online ear training platforms has expanded access to structured practice resources, as described by IWasDoingAllRight: "Ear training has been a regular part of my practice routine since the beginning of 2004, when I created the first version of my free online ear training tool". These digital tools allow students to practice identifying intervals, chords, and progressions with immediate feedback, providing structured approaches to developing aural skills that complement traditional transcription practices.

The range of technological resources has continued to expand, with applications designed to address specific aspects of ear training. As documented by JazzAdvice, contemporary jazz ear training must prepare musicians for the complex demands of real-time improvisation, including the ability to "learn tunes from recordings" and "hear chord changes and progressions easily". Modern digital tools address these needs through targeted exercises focusing on intervals, chord qualities, voicings, and progressions. These technological approaches maintain connections to the aural tradition while providing more systematic pathways for skill development.

## Integration of Technology in Educational Settings

Educational institutions have increasingly incorporated technological tools into their ear training curricula. Research from Silpakorn University describes a jazz ear training course that utilized "teaching materials (e.g., exercises, audio files, demonstration clips, and videos)" delivered through Google Classroom during the COVID-19 pandemic. This integration of digital resources allowed for continued instruction despite physical distancing requirements, illustrating the adaptability of contemporary ear training approaches.

The adaptation of traditional methods to digital formats represents an evolution rather than a revolution in jazz ear training pedagogy. As described in "Tools For Ear Training Pedagogy," contemporary approaches continue to emphasize the development of core aural skills while leveraging technology to enhance access and efficiency. The research conducted through interviews with thirteen music educators and professionals confirms that while the tools have evolved, the fundamental goal remains developing the ability to perceive and reproduce musical sounds accurately. This continued emphasis on aural skills maintains connections to jazz's origins as an aural tradition even as educational approaches become increasingly sophisticated.

## Conclusion

Record players, transcription books, and pattern books have each contributed to jazz ear training across the 20th and 21st centuries. Academic literature affirms that while written and technological resources are valuable, they must be embedded in a pedagogy that privileges listening. The most enduring jazz learning strategies integrate tools into a broader aural framework—preserving the tradition of learning music by ear, even in modern academic contexts

The historical development of approaches to improving playing by ear in jazz pedagogy reveals a gradual evolution from purely aural learning to increasingly systematized methods. As Liebman argues in his discussion of transcription practices, this process involves "a three part learning process: body, mind and spirit-in that order". This holistic view recognizes that effective ear training integrates physical, intellectual, and intuitive aspects of musical development, reflecting the multifaceted nature of jazz improvisation itself.

Despite the increasing systematization of jazz education, the fundamental importance of aural learning remains. Louise Denson's work on Third Stream Ear Training at the Queensland Conservatorium acknowledges that "aural training for improvisers is a specialized area of musicianship" requiring both "conventional skills" and "a high level of aural awareness which permits real-time reactions to a variety of musical stimuli and contexts". This recognition of the unique demands placed on jazz improvisers has led to specialized approaches that maintain connections to the aural tradition while incorporating more structured pedagogical methods.

The continued evolution of ear training approaches in jazz education reflects broader trends in the field, balancing respect for traditional aural learning with recognition of the benefits offered by more systematized methods and technological tools. This integration of approaches provides contemporary students with multiple pathways for developing the aural skills essential to effective jazz performance. As jazz education continues to evolve, maintaining this balance between aural tradition and systematized instruction remains a central challenge and opportunity for jazz pedagogy.


## Empirical Backgrounds: Systematic Musicological and Cognitive Psychological


The derivation of Slonimsky's *Thesaurus* - a new to document and rationalise logical melodic vocabulary - leads to a more general issue around combinatorics and musical (melodic) material.


# Music and combinatorics

- Introduce notion of large melodic learning vocabularies (LMLVs), ?

# Melody as Cognitive Psychology / Melodic represention

# Computed melodic features as a solution to selecting items



# Pattern books as item banks

The book has at least 1,400 discrete items and some of the patterns are terrifically long and complicated. Additionally, nearly all of the melodies are presented from a single note, C, and could be transposed to start on the other 11 chromatic tones. This means there are at least 16,800 (12 * 1400) items to be learned. The author’s saxophone tutor, who was a virtuoso, once said, "Oh, don't bother trying to learn [Slonimsky’s Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns] systematically". This was a wise comment since, as there is so much information, it is almost impossible for a human to comprehend and track their learning of it systematically. However, with advances in computation, this is a relatively easy challenge to solve once the data is in digital form. The author entered the Slonimsky’s Thesaurus corpus into his computer to provide a digital representation. This corpus will remain the test case for description in this document later on.
