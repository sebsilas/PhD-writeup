	abstract = {The ability to silently hear music in the mind has been argued to be fundamental to musicality. Objective measurements of this subjective imagery experience are needed if this link between imagery ability and musicality is to be investigated. However, previous tests of musical imagery either rely on self-report, rely on melodic memory, or do not cater in range of abilities. The Pitch Imagery Arrow Task ({PIAT}) was designed to address these shortcomings; however, it is impractically long. In this paper, we shorten the {PIAT} using adaptive testing and automatic item generation. We interrogate the cognitive processes underlying the {PIAT} through item response modelling. The result is an efficient online test of auditory mental imagery ability (adaptive Pitch Imagery Arrow Task: {aPIAT}) that takes 8 min to complete, is adaptive to participant’s individual ability, and so can be used to test participants with a range of musical backgrounds. Performance on the {aPIAT} showed positive moderate-to-strong correlations with measures of non-musical and musical working memory, self-reported musical training, and general musical sophistication. Ability on the task was best predicted by the ability to maintain and manipulate tones in mental imagery, as well as to resist perceptual biases that can lead to incorrect responses. As such, the {aPIAT} is the ideal tool in which to investigate the relationship between pitch imagery ability and musicality.},

	abstract = {Visuospatial working memory ({VSWM}) is essential to human cognitive abilities and is associated with important life outcomes such as academic performance. Recently, a number of reliable measures of {VSWM} have been developed to help understand psychological processes and for practical use in education. We sought to extend this work using Item Response Theory ({IRT}) and Computerised Adaptive Testing ({CAT}) frameworks to construct, calibrate and validate a new adaptive, computerised, and open-source {VSWM} test. We aimed to overcome the limitations of previous instruments and provide researchers with a valid and freely available {VSWM} measurement tool. The Jack and Jill ({JaJ}) {VSWM} task was constructed using explanatory item response modelling of data from a sample of the general adult population (Study 1, N = 244) in the {UK} and {US}. Subsequently, a static version of the task was tested for validity and reliability using a sample of adults from the {UK} and Australia (Study 2, N = 148) and a sample of Russian adolescents (Study 3, N = 263). Finally, the adaptive version of the {JaJ} task was implemented on the basis of the underlying {IRT} model and evaluated with another sample of Russian adolescents (Study 4, N = 239). {JaJ} showed sufficient internal consistency and concurrent validity as indicated by significant and substantial correlations with established measures of working memory, spatial ability, non-verbal intelligence, and academic achievement. The findings suggest that {JaJ} is an efficient and reliable measure of {VSWM} from adolescent to adult age.},

	abstract = {Prior research studying the relationship between music training ({MT}) and more general cognitive faculties, such as visuospatial working memory ({VSWM}), often fails to include tests of musical memory. This may result in causal pathways between {MT} and other such variables being misrepresented, potentially explaining certain ambiguous findings in the literature concerning the relationship between {MT} and executive functions. Here we address this problem using latent variable modeling and causal modeling to study a triplet of variables related to working memory: {MT}, musical working memory ({MWM}), and {VSWM}. The triplet framing allows for the potential application of d-separation (similar to mediation analysis) and V-structure search, which is particularly useful since, in the absence of expensive randomized control trials, it can test causal hypotheses using cross-sectional data. We collected data from 148 participants using a battery of {MWM} and {VSWM} tasks as well as a {MT} questionnaire. Our results suggest: 1) {VSWM} and {MT} are unrelated, conditional on {MWM}; and 2) by implication, there is no far transfer between {MT} and {VSWM} without near transfer. However, the data are unable to distinguish an unambiguous causal structure. We conclude by discussing the possibility of extending these models to incorporate more complex or cyclic effects.},

  abstract = {Most people in the Western world listen to music because of emotions. They want to create or experience emotions. But music is made of tones, tones are sound waves and sound waves are physics.How is it possible that physics becomes psychology, because emotions are a psychological phenomenon?When people like a certain piece of music, they usually want to listen to it again and again. Not infrequently for years and decades.What could be the reasons for this?When people like a piece of music, it is primarily the melody that they like. For most people, the melody is the face of a piece. More than anything else, it is the element of music they remember.What are the characteristics of melodies that make them to be remembered by listeners?What features of the melody could it be that ensure being liked by listeners?Based on more than 300 keywords, over 160 musical examples, and 39 charts, answers to these and many other questions are sought and offered in this book.This book is always two-in-one. By illuminating how melodies are built that enjoy great popularity, it is a book of music theory. In this way, it addresses readers who are primarily interested in the book because they themselves invent melodies. By illuminating what psychological mechanisms and physiological responses trigger the melodic operations of composers and improvisers, it is an introduction to music psychological thinking. It combines fundamental considerations from cognitive science, psychology, anthropology, and linguistics. Thus, it is addressed not only to music theorists and musicologists, but ultimately to all readers who wish to expand their knowledge of how melodies work.},
