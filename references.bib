The experimental groups received tonal training (the use of vocalization and solfege syllables to emphasize sensitivity to pitch relationships), while the control groups received traditional training. Post-treatment analysis of subjects' ear playing and sight reading achievement revealed that tonal training significantly affected ear playing achievement (p {$<$} .001), but did not significantly affect sight reading achievement (p {$>$} .05). These results suggest that tonal training, using standard method book melodies, may positively contribute to beginning wind instrumentalists ' melodic ear playing achievement without deterring the development of melodic sight reading achievement.}

More recently, the concept of working memory (WM), where short-term memory is composed of both storage and processing segments, has been considered. A. Baddeley (1990) proposed a model for WM that includes a central executive controller along with 2 slave systems: the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketch pad. The model allows for both storage and manipulation of information. However, this model does not seem to account adequately for musical memory. Through a literature review, a new model is proposed to account for musical information. Consideration of this kind of cognitive processing is important in understanding the demands placed on WM in such activities as taking musical dictation, where there would be a tradeoff between storage and processing functions.

The present paper investigates the practices and strategies used by conservatory-level music teachers to give lessons online in different European countries and the USA. Data from an exploratory qualitative study were collected using semi-structured interviews covering aspects such as curriculum design, lesson implementation, evaluation, examination organization, and time management skills. Interviewees offered rich descriptions of their experiences of teaching both music theory and instrumental lessons. Findings were analyzed using an inductive method, giving rise to the following categories: COVID-19 and the music school, technology, curriculum planning, managing instrumental lessons, examinations, strengths, and limitations. Participants discussed their ability to manage technology, and they employed skills such as flexibility, problem solving, and creativity in their curriculum planning and in using a variety of remote learning tools. They revised curricular activities and online teaching strategies and methods were associated with the musical instruments played. They argued that online teaching was very time consuming (e.g., planning activities, preparing materials, and exploring the new possibilities of technical tools) and that it was stressful to have lost a satisfactory work-life balance. They reported becoming more organized in the management of their activities. Internet platforms were found useful for sharing material, communicating, exchanging messages, and keeping records of all the work done. Participants learnt to use video clips systematically for modelling and teaching. They were aware of the strengths and limitations of e-learning, and they called for more institutional support and opportunities for professional development.},

The present work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms and acoustic cues used by the human perceptual system to achieve such accurate auditory localization.Acoustic cues are derived from the physical properties of sound waves, and many factors allow and influence auditory localization abilities. This review presents the monaural and binaural perceptual mechanisms involved in auditory localization in the three dimensions. Besides the main mechanisms of Interaural Time Difference, Interaural Level Difference and Head Related Transfer Function, secondary important elements such as reverberation and motion, are also analyzed. For each mechanism, the perceptual limits of localization abilities are presented. A section is specifically devoted to reference systems in space, and to the pointing methods used in experimental research. Finally, some cases of misperception and auditory illusion are described. More than a simple description of the perceptual mechanisms underlying localization, this paper is intended to provide also practical information available for experiments and work in the auditory field.},

  abstract = {Repetition is the most commonly used practice strategy by musicians. Although blocks of repetition continue to be suggested in the pedagogical literature, work in the field of cognitive psychology suggests that repeated events receive less processing, thereby reducing the potential for long-term learning. Motor skill learning and sport psychology research offer an alternative. Instead of using a blocked practice schedule, with practice completed on one task before moving on to the next task, an interleaved schedule can be used, in which practice is frequently alternated between tasks. This frequent alternation involves more effortful processing, resulting in increased long-term learning. The finding that practicing in an interleaved schedule leads to better retention than practicing in a blocked schedule has been labeled the ``contextual interference effect.'' While the effect has been observed across a wide variety of fields, few studies have researched this phenomenon in a music-learning context, despite the broad potential for application to music practice. This study compared the effects of blocked and interleaved practice schedules on advanced clarinet performance in an ecologically valid context. Ten clarinetists were given one concerto exposition and one technical excerpt to practice in a blocked schedule (twelve minutes per piece) and a second concerto exposition and technical excerpt to practice in an interleaved schedule (three minutes per piece, alternating until a total of twelve minutes of practice were completed on each piece). Participants sight-read the four pieces prior to practice and performed them at the end of practice and again one day later. The sight-reading and two performance run-throughs of each piece were recorded and given to three professional clarinetists to rate using a percentage scale. Overall, whenever there was a ratings difference between the conditions, pieces practiced in the interleaved schedule were rated better than those in the blocked schedule, although results varied across raters. Participant questionnaires also revealed that the interleaved practice schedule had positive effects on factors such as goal setting, focus, and mistake identification. Taken together, these results suggest that an interleaved practice schedule may be a more effective practice strategy than continuous repetition in a music-learning context.},

  abstract = {Short-term memory is also called short-term storage, primary memory, or active memory.~The term indicates different systems of memory involved in retaining pieces of information, or memory chunks, for a relatively short time, typically up to 30 seconds. In contrast, long-term memory may hold indefinite information. However, the difference is not just the time variable but also their overall functionality. Nevertheless, the~2 systems are closely related. Practically,~short-term memory functions as a temporary scratchpad for recalling a limited amount of data,~typically around 7 {\textpm} 2 items, in the verbal domain,~based on George Miller's concept. This information originates from the sensory register and can be processed through attention and recognition. In contrast, information collected in long-term memory storage consists of memories for performing actions or skills, such as procedural memories (knowing how), and memories of facts, rules, concepts, and events, such as declarative memories (knowing that). Declarative memory includes semantic and episodic memory. The former concerns broad~knowledge of facts, rules, concepts, and propositions (general knowledge), whereas the latter concerns personal and experienced events and the contexts in which they occurred (personal recollection). Although~short-term memory~is closely related to the concept of working memory, both are distinct entities. Short-term memory is a set of storage systems, whereas working memory indicates the cognitive operations and executive functions associated with the organization and manipulation of stored information. Nevertheless, the terms~short-term memory and~working memory~are often used interchangeably. Short-term memory must also be distinguished from sensory memory, such as the acoustical echoic and iconic visual memories, which are shorter in duration, typically fractions of a second, and reflect the stimulus's original sensation or perception. In other words,~sensory memory is specific to the stimulus modality of presentation. This raw sensory information undergoes processing and, upon processing to short-term, is expressed in a format different from that perceived initially. The famous Atkinson and Shiffrin (or multi-store) model, proposed in the late 1960s, explains the functional correlations between different types of memory.~Many studies demonstrated the anatomical and functional distinctions between memory processes, neural correlates, and the functioning of~short-term~and~long-term memory subsystems. In light of these findings, several memory models have been postulated.~Although some~authors suggested a single memory system encompassing both short- and long-term storage after 50 years, the Atkinson and Shiffrin model remains a valid approach for explaining the memory dynamics.~In light of recent research, however, the model has several problems, mostly concerning the characteristics of short-term memory, the relationship between~short-term and working memory,~and the transition from~short- to long-term memory.~ Short-Term Memory Short-term memory is a storage system that includes several subsystems with limited capacity. Rather than a limitation, this restriction is an evolutionary survival advantage, as paying attention to limited but essential information, excluding confounding factors, is important. A classic example in biology is prey, which must focus on the hostile environment to recognize a possible attack by the predator.~Given the functional peculiarities of short-term memory,~which involves the collection of sensory information, the subsystems are closely related to the modalities of sensory memory. Consequently, several sensory-associated subsystems have been postulated, including the visuospatial, phonological (auditory-verbal), tactile, and olfactory domains.~These subsystems involve patterns and functional interconnections with the corresponding cortical and subcortical areas and centers.~ The Concept of Working Memory In 1974, Baddeley and Hitch developed an alternative model called working memory. This model does not exclude the modal model but rather enriches~the contents. The short-term store can be used to characterize the functioning of the working memory. Working memory~refers~to the entire theoretical framework of the structures and processes used for storing and temporarily manipulating information, of which~short-term memory is only a component. In other words,~short-term memory is a functional storage element, whereas working memory is a set of processes involving storage phases. Working memory is constantly used when we have to understand new information, solve a problem, or make an argument, and it is the cognitive strategy for~achieving short-term goals. The importance of this~type of operating system of memory is~demonstrated by the evidence showing that~working memory deficits~are associated with~several developmental disorders of learning, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. A recent study on working and short-term memory in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder suggested that these children had an inadequate hemodynamic response in a region of the brain that underlies phonological working memory. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is a cost-effective, noninvasive neuroimaging technique that localizes and quantifies neural activation patterns related to executive functions.~Another study suggested that~working memory impairment and attention lapsing are general features of psychotic disorders. Findings regarding capacity estimates from the Change Localization and Detection tasks related to functional capacity and outcome also implied that these methods may be useful in a clinical context.~ Short-Term and Long-Term Memory Short-term and long-term memory can be distinguished based on storage capacity and duration.~Short-term memory~has limitations in the amount and duration of information maintained. In contrast, long-term memory features a seemingly unlimited capacity that can last years.~The functional distinctions between memory storage systems and the exact mechanisms for how memories transfer from~short-term~to long-term memory remain controversial. Do~short- and long-term memory~represent~1 or more systems with specific subsystems? Although short-term memory probably represents a substructure of long-term memory, a form of long-term--activated storage, rather than looking for a physical division, verifying the mechanisms involved in transitioning from short-term to long-term memory seems appropriate. Although the classic multi-modal model proposed that the storage of~short-term memories occurs automatically without manipulation, the matter seems more involved. The phenomenon concerns quantitative (number of memories) and qualitative (quality of memory) features. Regarding quantitative data, although the number of Miller of 7 {\textpm} 2 items identifies the number of elements included among individual slots, grouping memory bits~into larger chunks (chunking) can allow~for greater storage capacity. The qualitative issue, or memory modulation within processing, is fascinating. Short-term memory elements undergo processing, providing~a sort of editing involving each element's fragmentation (chunking) and re-elaboration. This phase of memory processing is called encoding and can condition subsequent processing, including storage~and retrieval. The encoding process encompasses automatic (without conscious awareness) and effortful processing (through attention, practice, and thought) and allows us to retrieve information to make decisions and answer questions.~Three pathways are followed during the encoding step---visual (information represented as a picture), acoustic (information represented as a sound), and semantic encoding (the meaning of the information). These processes interconnect,~breaking down information into various components. During recovery, the pathway that has produced the coding facilitates the recovery of the other components through a chain reaction.~A particular perfume, for instance, makes us recall a specific episode or image. The encoding process affects the recovery, but the recovery undergoes potential changes that can alter the initial content. In neurofunctional~terms, the difference is the occurrence in long-term memory of a series of events that must definitively fix the engram(s). This effect occurs through the establishment of neural networks and is expressed as a neurofunctional phenomenon, including long-term potentiation, which is an increase in the strength of the neural transmission deriving from the strengthening of synaptic connections. This process requires gene expression and the synthesis of new proteins and is related to long-lasting structural alterations in the synapses (synaptic consolidation) of the brain areas involved, such as the hippocampus in declarative memories. The Role of the Hippocampal Network Hippocampal neurogenesis regulates the maintenance of long-term potentiation. However, the~hippocampal network, including the parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, and neocortical areas, is not the storage site for memories but plays a crucial role in forming new memories and their subsequent reactivation. The hippocampus appears to have a limited capacity but acquires information quickly and~automatically.~Over time, the initially available information~is permanent in other brain structures,~particularly the cortex), independently from the activity of the hippocampus itself. The crucial mechanism of this transfer involves the reactivation (replay) of neural activity configurations. In other words, the connected hippocampus and the medial temporal structures are crucial for holding an event as a whole as they distribute memory traces in an organized manner. The operating system can store, organize, process, and recover hardware files through different software.~This hippocampal-guided reactivation (retrieval) leads to the creation of direct connections between the cortical traces and then to the~formation of an integrated representation in the neocortex, including the visual association cortex for visual memory, the temporal cortex for auditory memory, and the left lateral temporal cortex for knowledge of word meanings. Moreover, the hippocampus has other specific tasks, such as spatial memory organization. Recent reviews summarized the progress of hippocampal circuits and functions based on sharp-wave ripples. These ripples are crucial for consolidating spatial, episodic, and social memories in different hippocampal-cortical pathways. Dysregulation of sharp-wave ripples contributes to cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.~Other brain areas are involved in memory processes; for example, learning motor skills has links to the activation of the cerebellar regions and brainstem nuclei. Learning perceptive activities, including~improvements in processing perceptive stimuli essential in everyday life activities such as understanding spoken and written language, involves basal ganglia and sensory and associative cortices. In contrast, learning cognitive skills related to problem-solving involves the medial temporal lobes.},

Both the general style and a particular piece are modeled using dual short-term and long-term theories, and the model is created using machine learning techniques on a corpus of musical examples. The models are used for analysis and prediction, and we conjecture that highly predictive theories will also generate original, acceptable, works. Although the quality of the works generated is hard to quantify objectively, the predictive power of models can be measured by the notion of entropy, or unpredictability. Highly predictive theories will produce low-entropy estimates of a musical language. The methods developed are applied to the Bach chorale melodies. Multiple-viewpoint systems are learned from a sample of 95 chorales, estimates of entropy are produced, and a predictive theory is used to...},

Recent works have indicated the establishment of a functional connection between auditory and motor cortices during the learning of a novel piece, although no causal relation has yet been demonstrated. Here transcranial magnetic stimulation of the cortical motor representation involved in musical performance was used to test excitability changes in piano players during auditory presentation of a rehearsed and a non-rehearsed piece. Results showed an increased motor excitability for the rehearsed but not for the non-rehearsed piece. Moreover, we observed an increase of excitability over time as intracortical facilitation was already present after 30 min of training whereas cortico-spinal facilitation increased after a longer training period (5 days).},

The basic notions of explanatory item response models (EIRM) are explained in this chapter and three kinds of application are presented. All three applications are based on data from a spelling test and the lme4 code for model estimation is included for all three. The first application illustrates how EIRM can be used as a technology for test construction and item generation, starting from the explanation of item difficulties even when that explanation is far from perfect. The second application demonstrates how EIRM can be a basis for diagnostic assessment through the explanation of test performance based on item attributes linked with cognitive processes. The third application shows how EIRM provides us with a tool to correct ability estimates that are affected by confounding using a new dimensionality method that allows the source of confounding to vary depending on the person.},

Drawing on much new information, the book traces early Schoenberg pioneers in America, who set the stage for Schoenberg's arrival in 1933. The volume addresses in detail how Schoenberg while coming to terms with his German and Jewish identities, thoroughly adapted to American society both privately and professionally. New light is cast on Schoenberg's relations with Americans, his interest in American culture, and changes in his religious and political thinking and lifestyle. As Schoenberg was committed to the advancement of American music and composed music inspired by and composed for American musicians, his American works are examined anew with regard to their contexts and the history of their performance and publication. Schoenberg's many interactions with performers and publishers in the United States are explored as well. Illustrating how Schoenberg adjusted to the American educational system, the book delves into Schoenberg's American teaching career, teaching methods and materials and features some of the many remarkable students he taught in Boston and Los Angeles. Finally the impact of Schoenberg's music and ideas on American performers, composers and scholars after World War II is gauged in the light of major political and cultural changes during the Cold War era. Schoenberg's New World contributes to a new understanding of one of the most important pioneers of musical modernism and most polarizing figures in twentieth-century music.},

  abstract = {When memory is tested after a delay, performance is typically better if the retention interval includes sleep. However, it is unclear what accounts for this well-established effect. It is possible that sleep enhances the retrieval of information, but it is also possible that sleep protects against memory loss that normally occurs during waking activity. We developed a new research approach to investigate these possibilities. Participants learned a list of paired-associate items and were tested on the items after a 12-h interval that included waking or sleep. We analyzed the number of items gained versus the number of items lost across time. The sleep condition showed more items gained and fewer items lost than did the wake condition. Furthermore, the difference between the conditions (favoring sleep) in lost items was greater than the difference in gain, suggesting that loss prevention may primarily account for the effect of sleep on declarative memory consolidation. This finding may serve as an empirical constraint on theories of memory consolidation.},

  abstract = {Ear training is a vital element in music education, analogous to taking dictation in written language. It provides musicians with a crucial skill used to identify pitches, melodies, chords and rhythms. Traditionally, the training is conducted by a tutor using a musical instrument, typically a piano. However, with new technologies emerging, several computer applications to facilitate this aspect of music education have been developed. Nevertheless, none of them utilised the VR technology, that proved to be successful in various scenarios, including educational systems, simulations, etc. In this work, we designed and developed a virtual reality ear training system for interval recognition and investigated its usability and user experience and the effect of spatialised audio in a 3D virtual environment on user performance. The results showed that the system has been successfully designed and provides users with a great experience when using it.},

Degree: Ph.D.DegreeYear: 1992Institute: University of MichiganThe primary purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between expertise of one''s principal instrument and the ear-to-hand performance achievement of various aural melodic patterns. Melodic patterns were constructed in such a manner as to reflect three degrees of contextual constraint from classical Western tonal music.Subjects were selected from those who are professional expert violists and those who are amateur novice violists, taking as subjects those who play viola in two professional orchestras and in two high school orchestras. One professional orchestra research group and one high school orchestra research group was assigned to one of two tests: Test of Musical Context (TMC) or Computer Generated Test of Musical Context (CGTMC). The TMC and CGTMC differed in the manner by which the melodic patterns were selected. In the TMC, the patterns were constructed by hand; in the CGTMC, the patterns were generated by a computer. The two tests were designed by the investigator as a three-subtest battery to assess the respondent''s ability to replicate music patterns in a listen-imitate format (ear-to-hand). The patterns ranged from random music approximations (Subtest 1) to music patterns generated from systematically increased degrees of contextual constraint simulating classical Western tonal music (Subtests 2 and 3).Differences between groups on the TMC Subtests 1, 2, and 3 and CGTMC Subtests 2 and 3 were significant favoring the expert research groups. It appears that ear-to-hand skills are affected by expertise of one''s principal instrument. However, when the melodic patterns were randomly generated for the CGTMC (Subtest 1), there were no differences between novice and expert subjects'' performances of the melodic patterns. In addition, as the contextual constraint used in generating the melodic patterns between subtests increased, a significant difference occurred in the TMC and the CGTMC scores between subtests for expert subjects, but not for novice subjects. It appears that the expert learning of music involves learning the general coding system based on the probabilities that characterize music patterns in classical Western tonal music. function show\_abstract() \{   \$('\#abstract1').hide();   \$('\#abstract2').show();   \$('\#abstract\_expand').hide(); \} \ding{116}{\cyrchar\CYRP}{\cyrchar\cyro}{\cyrchar\cyrk}{\cyrchar\cyra}{\cyrchar\cyrz}{\cyrchar\cyra}{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyrsftsn} {\cyrchar\cyrp}{\cyrchar\cyro}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyrn}{\cyrchar\cyro}{\cyrchar\cyrs}{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyrsftsn}{\cyrchar\cyryu}},

The review of over 350 studies (including classroom-based technologies, individual study tools, network-based social computing, and mobile and portable devices) revealed that, in spite of an abundance of publications available on the topic of technology use in FL learning and teaching, evidence of efficacy is limited. However, strong support for the claim that technology made a measurable impact in FL learning came from studies on computer-assisted pronunciation training, in particular, automatic speech recognition (ASR). These studies demonstrated that ASR can facilitate the improvement of pronunciation and can provide feedback effectively. Additional studies provided strong support for the use of chat in FL learning. These studies showed that, with chat, both the amount of learners' language production and its complexity significantly increased. The literature revealed moderate support for claims that technology enhanced learners' output and interaction, affect and motivation, feedback, and metalinguistic knowledge.},

  abstract = {This pioneering book reveals how the music classroom can draw upon the world of popular musicians\&\#39; informal learning practices, so as to recognise and foster a range of musical skills and knowledge that have long been overlooked within music education. It investigates how far informal learning practices are possible and desirable in a classroom context; how they can affect young teenagers\&\#39; musical skill and knowledge acquisition; and how they can change the ways students listen to, understand and appreciate music as critical listeners, not only in relation to what they already know, but beyond.It examines students\&\#39; motivations towards music education, their autonomy as learners, and their capacity to work co-operatively in groups without instructional guidance from teachers. It suggests how we can awaken students\&\#39; awareness of their own musicality, particularly those who might not otherwise be reached by music education, putting the potential for musical development and participation into their own hands.Bringing informal learning practices into a school environment is challenging for teachers. It can appear to conflict with their views of professionalism, and may at times seem to run against official educational discourses, pedagogic methods and curricular requirements. But any conflict is more apparent than real, for this book shows how informal learning practices can introduce fresh, constructive ways for music teachers to understand and approach their work. It offers a critical pedagogy for music, not as mere theory, but as an analytical account of practices which have fundamentally influenced the perspectives of the teachers involved.Through its grounded examples and discussions of alternative approaches to classroom work and classroom relations, the book reaches out beyond music to other curriculum subjects, and wider debates about pedagogy and curriculum.},

T-tests showed that the aural/modeling group scored higher on two posttests, the Watkins Farnum Performance Scale and a prepared piece, though not significantly. Aural/modeling participants without prior training scored the highest followed by visual participants with prior training. There was a significant (r = .668, p {$<$} .01) and positive relationship between posttest scores. Teaching with an aural/modeling emphasis does not hamper participants' music performance skills, and may aid them.},

Brain surface current density (BSCD) reconstructions revealed a spatial dissociation of this activity between notes preferably played by the thumb and the little finger according to the motor homunculus.

A large majority reported both frequent sight-reading instruction (74\%) and individual assessment (70\%) in their prior instruction. Whereas 94\% of these students previously had been assessed live, only five students had been assessed through recording and one by computer. Preassessment opinions (69\% favorable/neutral) shifted substantially (69\% negative) after experiencing computer-based assessment. Inability to set the tempo was cited as the predominant reason for disliking the technology. Results indicate great potential for using technology in vocal sight-reading instruction and assessment. However, it is important that students' introduction to it be intentional and thorough. Adequate practice and comfort must be established for students to trust and appreciate this new instructional tool.},

But music is made of tones, tones are sound waves and sound waves are physics.How is it possible that physics becomes psychology, because emotions are a psychological phenomenon?When people like a certain piece of music, they usually want to listen to it again and again. Not infrequently for years and decades.What could be the reasons for this?When people like a piece of music, it is primarily the melody that they like. For most people, the melody is the face of a piece. More than anything else, it is the element of music they remember.What are the characteristics of melodies that make them to be remembered by listeners?What features of the melody could it be that ensure being liked by listeners?Based on more than 300 keywords, over 160 musical examples, and 39 charts, answers to these and many other questions are sought and offered in this book.This book is always two-in-one. By illuminating how melodies are built that enjoy great popularity, it is a book of music theory. In this way, it addresses readers who are primarily interested in the book because they themselves invent melodies. By illuminating what psychological mechanisms and physiological responses trigger the melodic operations of composers and improvisers, it is an introduction to music psychological thinking. It combines fundamental considerations from cognitive science, psychology, anthropology, and linguistics. Thus, it is addressed not only to music theorists and musicologists, but ultimately to all readers who wish to expand their knowledge of how melodies work.},

Through listening to the sound of music, very young children soon imitate the tones they hear. Suzuki believes that talent is not inherited, but is a product of environment, and that every child can perform music just as he has learned to speak, if the proper teaching approach is used. Revised in 1995, The Man and His Philosophy contains many new photos, some of them depicting the many \&quot;firsts\&quot; in the Suzuki world, such as Dr. Suzuki with his first students, plus much more.

  abstract = {While laboratory research is the backbone of collecting experimental data in cognitive science, a rapidly increasing amount of research is now capitalizing on large-scale and real-world digital data. Each piece of data is a trace of human behavior and offers us a potential clue to understanding basic cognitive principles. However, we have to be able to put the pieces together in a reasonable way, which necessitates both advances in our theoretical models and development of new methodological techniques.  The primary goal of this volume is to present cutting-edge examples of mining large-scale and naturalistic data to discover important principles of cognition and evaluate theories that would not be possible without such a scale. This book also has a mission to stimulate cognitive scientists to consider new ways to harness big data in order to enhance our understanding of fundamental cognitive processes. Finally, this book aims to warn of the potential pitfalls of using, or being over-reliant on, big data and to show how big data can work alongside traditional, rigorously gathered experimental data rather than simply supersede it.  In sum, this groundbreaking volume presents cognitive scientists and those in related fields with an exciting, detailed, stimulating, and realistic introduction to big data -- and to show how it may greatly advance our understanding of the principles of human memory, perception, categorization, decision-making, language, problem-solving, and representation.},

Musicians responded to metronomic pacing signals by producing three unpaced taps on three vertically aligned keys at the given tempo. Taps triggered tones in two out of three blocked feedback conditions, where key-to-tone mappings were compatible or incompatible in terms of spatial and pitch height. Results indicate that, while timing was most accurate without tones, movements were smaller in amplitude and less forceful (i.e., acceleration prior to impact was lowest) when tones were present. Moreover, timing was more accurate and movements were less forceful with compatible than with incompatible auditory feedback. Observing these effects at the first tap (before tone onset) suggests that anticipatory auditory imagery modulates the temporal kinematics of regularly timed auditory action sequences, like those found in music. Such cross-modal ideomotor processes may function to facilitate planning efficiency and biomechanical economy in voluntary action. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {This paper examines the role of mental imagery in music performance. Self-reports by musicians, and various other sources of anecdotal evidence, suggest that covert auditory, motor, and/or visual imagery facilitate multiple aspects of music performance. The cognitive and motor mechanisms that underlie such imagery include working memory, action simulation, and internal models. Together these mechanisms support the generation of anticipatory images that enable thorough action planning and movement execution that is characterized by efficiency, temporal precision, and biomechanical economy. In ensemble performance, anticipatory imagery may facilitate interpersonal coordination by enhancing online predictions about others' action timing. Overlap in brain regions subserving auditory imagery and temporal prediction is consistent with this view. It is concluded that individual differences in anticipatory imagery may be a source of variation in expressive performance excellence and the quality of ensemble cohesion. Engaging in effortful musical imagery is therefore justified when artistic perfection is the goal.},

We tested whether response-effect compatibility (REC) affects the execution of music-like sequential actions that require temporal regularity rather than rapidity. Musicians responded to metronomic visual stimuli by producing sequences of three taps at a specific tempo on three vertically aligned keys. Each tap triggered a tone. Key-to-tone mapping was either compatible or incompatible in terms of spatial height and pitch height. The results indicated that tap timing was more accurate with compatible than with incompatible mappings, both for taps produced before (Tap 1) and after (Taps 2 and 3) the onset of auditory feedback. Thus, the observed influence of REC on action execution was not due exclusively to actual auditory feedback. The anticipation of distal action effects may be involved in planning the dynamics of temporally precise movements.},

The first was to analyse Zolt{\'a}n Kod{\'a}ly's philosophy of music education and, on this basis, to develop a computer-assisted instruction method (CAI) for teaching music theory and solf{\`e}ge (ear-training). The second task was to experiment with the effectiveness of this method and compare it with traditional approaches to teaching. Many student find music theory and ear training difficult. During the 1990s, in connection with my licentiate thesis ``Solf{\`e}ge in the Computer Classroom'' (2000), I initiated this research project, and developed a CAI method for teaching music theory and solf{\`e}ge. I wanted to see just how useful Kod{\'a}ly's approach could be in computer-aided teaching and learning. The results show that the Kod{\'a}ly approach can be successfully applied to the development of a computer-aided solf{\`e}ge programme and the Kod{\'a}ly system is applicable to new learning environments and teaching practices. In music education CAI is an area with great potential for development. It offers multiple learning options and can enhance students' motivation to study music theory and ear-training; some of the learning outcomes were even better than with the traditional ways of learning. The results also show, however, that the teacher-pupil interaction is essential in a computer-aided learning programme.},

All the chapters combine a solid review of the relevant literature with well-reasoned arguments and robust discussions of the major findings, as well as original insights and suggestions for future work. Written by leading experts, the 52 chapters are divided into 11 sections covering both experimental and theoretical perspectives, each edited by an internationally recognised authority Ten sections each present chapters that focus on specific areas of music psychology: - the origins and functions of music - music perception - responses to music - music and the brain - musical development - learning musical skills - musical performance - composition and improvisation - the role of music in our everyday lives - music therapy and conceptual frameworks In each section, expert authors critically review the literature, highlight current issues, and explore possibilities for the future. The final section examines how in recent years the study of music psychology has broadened to include a range of other scientific disciplines. It considers the way that the research has developed in relation to technological advances, fostering links across the field and providing an overview of the areas where the field needs further development in the future.

  abstract = {Absolute pitch (AP) is the ability to identify and name the pitch of a sound without external reference. Often, accuracy and speed at naming isolated musical pitches are correlated with demographic, biological and acoustical parameters to gain insight into the genesis and evolution of this ability in specific cohorts. However, the majority of those studies were conducted in North America, Europe or Asia. To fill this gap, here we investigated the pitch-naming performance in a large population of Brazilian conservatory musicians (N = 200). As previously shown, we found that the population performance was rather a continuum than an "all-or-none" ability. By comparing the observed distribution of correct responses to a theoretical binomial distribution, we estimated the prevalence of AP as being 18\% amongst regular music students. High accuracy thresholds (e.g., 85\% of correct responses) yielded a prevalence of 4\%, suggesting that AP might have been underestimated in previous reports. Irrespective of the threshold used, AP prevalence was higher in musicians who started their musical practice and formal musical education early in life. Finally, we compared the performance of those music students (average proficiency group) with another group of students selected to take part in the conservatory orchestra (high proficiency group, N = 30). Interestingly, the prevalence of AP was higher in the later in comparison to the former group. In addition, even when the response was incorrect, the mean absolute deviation from the correct response was smaller in the high proficiency group compared to the average proficiency group (Glass's {$\Delta$}: 0.5). Taken together, our results show that the prevalence of AP in Brazilian students is similar to other non-tonal language populations, although this measure is highly dependent on the scoring threshold used. Despite corroborating that early involvement with musical practice and formal education can foster AP ability, the present data suggest that music proficiency may also play an important role in AP expression.},

By employing two paradigms that differed widely in musical complexity, we found that improvisation (compared to production of over-learned musical sequences) was consistently characterized by a dissociated pattern of activity in the prefrontal cortex: extensive deactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral orbital regions with focal activation of the medial prefrontal (frontal polar) cortex. Such a pattern may reflect a combination of psychological processes required for spontaneous improvisation, in which internally motivated, stimulus-independent behaviors unfold in the absence of central processes that typically mediate self-monitoring and conscious volitional control of ongoing performance. Changes in prefrontal activity during improvisation were accompanied by widespread activation of neocortical sensorimotor areas (that mediate the organization and execution of musical performance) as well as deactivation of limbic structures (that regulate motivation and emotional tone). This distributed neural pattern may provide a cognitive context that enables the emergence of spontaneous creative activity.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims: Although the use of technology integration in music education in China has gradually increased, there is still a lack of empirical evidence on the use of educational technology, particularly digital tools, in auditory training. Traditional auditory training methods, such as manual practice guided by a piano or teachers, had some educational value; however, in large-scale classroom settings, they were frequently hampered by individual differences, time constraints, and insufficient teaching resources, making it difficult to meet students' individualized learning needs, particularly in key areas such as pitch recognition, rhythm perception, and timbre discrimination.~ As a result, understanding how to use modern educational technology to improve the effectiveness of auditory training and close this gap was critical for practical purposes. Against this backdrop, this study innovatively integrated Earmaster, a digital tool specifically designed for music education, into auditory training courses at Chinese universities, to investigate its effectiveness in improving students' auditory skills. By providing personalized practice plans and instant feedback, Earmaster effectively addressed issues in traditional teaching methods caused by resource constraints or individual differences. This study used constructivist learning theory to discuss how to use Earmaster to help students improve their pitch recognition, rhythm perception, and timbre discrimination skills. This not only improved empirical research on technology in music education but also provided theoretical foundations and practical references for future educational technology applications. Materials and Methods: This study adopts a quasi-experimental approach. The researchers selected a total of 67 first-year music students from a university in Fujian. After classifying the students according to the school's class capacity, they were divided into Music Class 1 (34 students) and Music Class 2 (33 students). Class 1 served as the control group, while Class 2 was the experimental group. The entire experiment lasted 10 weeks, with two classes per week, each lasting 90 minutes. In the first week, students were introduced to the experiment, the teaching methods, and the content. All 67 students took a pre-test to assess their actual musical abilities. Starting from the second week, the two groups underwent 8 weeks of training with the same teaching content. Music Class 1 followed traditional teaching methods, while Music Class 2 received instruction using the Earmaster software. Classroom exercises and homework were also conducted using Earmaster. In the tenth week, a post-test was conducted. The researchers compiled and analyzed the process data and post-test results, comparing the changes between the pre-test and post-test. Results: This study integrated the digital tool Earmaster into auditory training courses at Chinese universities and demonstrated its efficacy in improving students' auditory skills. The findings revealed that after a structured intervention with Earmaster, students' performance in pitch recognition, rhythm perception, and timbre discrimination improved significantly.~ Earmaster addressed the issues caused by resource limitations and individual differences in large-scale classroom settings more effectively than traditional auditory training methods, using personalized exercises and instant feedback. This study not only addressed an empirical gap in the use of educational technology in auditory training, but it also provided theoretical foundations and practical references for the future use of digital tools in music education. Conclusion: This study found that the digital tool Earmaster significantly improved students' auditory skills compared to traditional methods. It provided both empirical evidence and practical insights into the future use of digital tools in music education.},

In search of opportunities for the development of novel human-recording interactions, we analyze 18 YouTube videos depicting real-world examples of by-ear learning, and discuss why, during this preliminary phase of research, online videos are appropriate data. From our observations we generate hypotheses that can inform future work. For example, a musician's scope of learning may influence what technological interactions would help them, they could benefit from tools that accommodate their working memory, and transcription does not appear to play a key role in ear learning. Based on these findings, we pose a number of research questions, and discuss their methodological considerations to guide future study.},

This paper analyzes a selection of Coltrane's works that exhibit ingenious departures from convention, but arguably remain tonal. Building on an earlier article (Martin 2011) that analyzes a group of jazz standards written before 1950, this study also explores the concept of prolongation by arrival a technique that allows one to posit prolongations over 4- and 8-bar units in which conventional techniques are lacking. The paper concludes with Coltrane's well-known "Giant Steps," in which I argue that despite its famous use of three tonics related by major third (G, B, and the piece is in Et major. From the analyses of these pieces, we see Coltrane in the 1950s and 1960s extending the traditional jazz repertory to include richly imaginative tunes with varying degrees of tonal centricity, intriguing prolongational structures, and creative adaptation of form. I conclude with a summary of the background forms suggested by this group of Coltrane tunes.},

For part three, 16 variables related to subjects' musical background were examined in order to determine the degree of correlation between these variables and the five performance skills. Results show a pattern of higher correlations between the five types of performance as instrumentalists mature.

The children were administered tests at the end of each school year to assess their abilities to perform rehearsed music, sight-read, play from memory, play by ear and improvise, and interviews were completed with the children's mothers in order to calculate how much practice they had accumulated on their instrument. Data were also obtained to help clarify the quality of mental strategies the children adopted when performing. Findings extend previous research on skill acquisition by proposing that conceptions based on the amount of practice undertaken or that focus exclusively on children's ability to reproduce rehearsed literature from notation are inadequate to understanding the early stages of instrumental development. It is proposed that a more coherent explanation comes from understanding the range of strategies children employ when performing and that the sophistication of children's mental strategies provides an important means for understanding why some progress effortlessly in contrast to others who struggle and fail. Conclusions highlight the importance of helping students to develop a repertoire of task-appropriate strategies that will enable them to think musically when performing challenging tasks on their instrument.},

The Watkins-Farnum Performance Scale (WFPS) was administered to 101 high school clarinet and trumpet students who were completing Australian Music Examinations Board (AMEB) performance examinations. Findings show that, in the beginning stages of training, sightreading skill is not significantly correlated with the ability to perform a repertoire of rehearsed music for a comprehensive performance examination as assessed on the AMEB examination. As instrumentalists mature, however, correlations between these two aspects of performance seem to strengthen markedly. Consistent with other studies, results show that rhythmic errors far outweigh all other types of errors. Differing strategies used by high-scoring and low-scoring subjects on the WFPS and by two groups of high school subjects in school years 7-9 and 10-12 were observed and discussed.},

Performing a repertoire of rehearsed music was found to be influenced most by an ability to sight-read, together with a factor consisting of variables concerned with the length of time a subject had been studying his or her instrument and taking lessons. In sharp contrast, an ability to improvise was most markedly influenced by an ability to play by ear.

Two meta-analyses were conducted; one comprised experimental research measuring rhythmic sight reading (46 studies; 68 individual analyses) and another comprised research measuring melodic sight reading (21 studies; 35 individual analyses). Analyses revealed small overall effect sizes (Rhythmic: d = -0.34, 95\% CI [-0.50, --0.19]; Melodic: d = -0.35, 95\% CI [-0.59, --0.12]). Moderator variables were used to examine how effect size was influenced by treatment type and other study-level design elements. Treatment type significantly influenced both rhythmic and melodic sight reading. For rhythm, treatments that focused on counting systems and included movement or rhythmic drill positively affected sight reading. Melodic results are preliminary due to the limited number of studies, but based on the information available, treatments using collaboration activities or instrumental training positively affected sight reading. Varying notation did not improve sight reading. The type of sight reading (rhythmic, melodic) significantly affected the effectiveness of some treatments.},

  abstract = {Cognitive psychology has long had the aim of understanding mechanisms of human memory, with the expectation that such an understanding will yield practical techniques that support learning and retention. Although research insights have given rise to qualitative advice for students and educators, we present a complementary approach that offers quantitative, individualized guidance. Our approach synthesizes theory-driven and data-driven methodologies. Psychological theory characterizes basic mechanisms of human memory shared among members of a population, whereas machine-learning techniques use observations from a population to make inferences about individuals. We argue that despite the power of big data, psychological theory provides essential constraints on models. We present models of forgetting and spaced practice that predict the dynamic time-varying knowledge state of an individual student for specific material. We incorporate these models into retrieval-practice software to assist students in reviewing previously mastered material. In an ambitious year-long intervention in a middle-school foreign language course, we demonstrate the value of systematic review on long-term educational outcomes, but more specifically, the value of adaptive review that leverages data from a population of learners to personalize recommendations based on an individual's study history and past performance.}

  abstract = {Tune plagiarism in pop music is a common and often feverishly debated phenomenon which surely has to do with the vast amounts of money that individual melodies are able to generate in today's pop music business. The similarity between melodies is assumed to be a very important factor in a court's decision about whether a new tune is an illegitimate version of a pre-existing melody. Despite the wide-spread belief that there is a fixed and simple limit to the number of corresponding notes between two melodies, actual court decisions are based on far more complex considerations regarding the musical material., This paper first sketches the legal framework and principal features of the legal processing of cases of alleged melodic plagiarism with a focus on US copyright law and discusses selected cases to highlight the corresponding legal practices. In the empirical part of this paper, we model court decisions for cases of alleged melodic plagiarism employing a number of similarity algorithms. As a ground truth dataset we use a collection of 20 publicly available cases from the last 30 years of US jurisdiction. We compare the performance of standard similarity algorithms (edit distance and n-gram similarity measures) to several new similarity algorithms that make use of statistical information about the prevalence of chains of pitch intervals in a large pop music database. Results indicate that these statistically informed algorithms generally outperform the comparison algorithms. In particular, algorithms based on Tversky's (1977) concept of similarity show a high performance of up to 90\% of court decisions correctly predicted. We discuss the performance and structure of the algorithms in relation to a few interesting example cases and give an outlook on the potential and intricacies of our approach.},

First, a quick overview of our mathematical systematization for similarity measures, including data transformations and calculation methods is given. Behavioral data from three listener experiments is used to model experts' similarity judgments of short melodies from popular music in different contextual situations. A weighted combination of several similarity measures, representing two resp. three different sources of information, is found to explain user ratings best. As an application example one of the optimal similarity measures resulting from these three experiments is used to analyze a body of about 600 folk melodies from Luxembourg. Finally, the expert classification of the individual phrases of these melodies that has carried out in an extensive ethno-musicological study (Sagrillo, 1999) is reconstructed with the help of an optimal combination of similarity measures using logistic regression.},

A large number of algorithmic similarity measure found in the literature were mathematically systematised and implemented. The best similarity algorithms compared to human experts were chosen and optimised by statistical means according to different contexts. A multidimensional scaling model of the algorithmic similarity measures is constructed to give an overiew over the different musical dimensions reflected by these measures. We show some examples where this optimised methods could be successfully applied to real world problems like folk song categorisation and analysis, and discuss further applications and implications.},

  abstract = {This literature review examines current thoughts, practices, and research on playing by ear, defined here as performance from memory of pre-existing music that was learned aurally without the aid of notation, without the visual stimulus of watching a live instrumental model, and without verbal hints such as being told the solfege. Research has investigated skill development with and without specific training, the correlation of skills with music reading and other variables, and the effects of play-by-ear instruction. There exists more research on learning by rote than learning by ear, and extant research is difficult to interpret because treatment protocols frequently involved a mix of instructional activities. Nonetheless, the literature to date supports the importance and efficacy of aural-based instructional activities, including learning by ear. The literature review concludes with a discussion of teacher concerns, potential resolutions, and suggestions for future research, which might include surveys of current practices, documented strategies for learning and teaching, longitudinal studies, and investigations that more clearly delineate the effects of learning by ear.}

Here we review behavioral and neurophysiological (M/EEG, TMS and fMRI) research exploring this topic using the brain of musicians as a model system. Our review focuses on a recent body of evidence suggesting that this form of coupling might have (at least) two cognitive functions. First, it leads to the generation of equivalent predictions (concerning both when and what event is more likely to occur) during both perception and production of music. Second, it underpins the common coding of perception and action that supports the integration of the motor output of multiple musicians' in the context of joint musical tasks. Essentially, training-based coupling of perception and action might scaffold the human ability to represent complex (structured) actions and to entrain multiple agents-via reciprocal prediction and adaptation-in the pursuit of shared goals.},

  abstract = {The recordings Stellar Regions and Interstellar Space, made by John Coltrane shortly before his death in 1967, are among his least studied and understood works. While these recordings are generally regarded as representative of ``free jazz,'' three case studies present evidence that Coltrane's improvisations on these recordings are highly organized, utilizing a structural methodology focused on trichordal pitch-class sets. Musical set theory is used as a primary analytical tool in combination with common jazz harmonic and improvisational practices. Analyses will illustrate the extensive use of Tn-types (0,1,3) in ``Iris,'' and (0,2,4), and (0,2,5) in ``Saturn.'' As an exemplar of this methodology, compelling evidence in ``Iris'' demonstrates the use of Tn-type (0,1,3), as a structural progenitor for both the saxophone improvisation and piano accompaniment for the entire length of the piece. En route, the potential influence of Nicolas Slonimsky's Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns (1947) is examined. As an archetype for an improvisational methodology focused on pitch-class sets, the significance of ``Iris'' resonates throughout Stellar Regions and Interstellar Space and more broadly to Coltrane's other late-period recordings, challenging the persistent characterization of this music as chaotic and ``free.''}

Patel challenges the widespread belief that music and language are processed independently. Since Plato's time, the relationship between music and language has attracted interest and debate from a wide range of thinkers. Recently, scientific research on this topic has been growing rapidly, as scholars from diverse disciplines, including linguistics, cognitive science, music cognition, and neuroscience are drawn to the music-language interface as one way to explore the extent to which different mental abilities are processed by separate brain mechanisms. Accordingly, the relevant data and theories have been spread across a range of disciplines. This volume provides the first synthesis, arguing that music and language share deep and critical connections, and that comparative research provides a powerful way to study the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these uniquely human abilities.Winner of the 2008 ASCAP Deems Taylor Award},

But today, that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, sparked by world-renowned computer scientist Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has cut through a century of confusion and placed cause and effect on a firm scientific basis. Now, Pearl and science journalist Dana Mackenzie explain causal thinking to general readers for the first time, showing how it allows us to explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been. It is the essence of human and artificial intelligence. And just as Pearl's discoveries have enabled machines to think better, The Book of Why explains how we too can think better.'Pearl's accomplishments over the last 30 years have provided the theoretical basis for progress in artificial intelligence and have redefined the term "thinking machine"' Vint Cerf},

Strategies were combined across single and dual melodic presentations to see if any of three methods were significantly more effective regardless of the number of presentations. Results of the analysis revealed no significant differences (.05) among the strategies. When the six groups were analyzed individually, significantly higher scores were revealed for Groups 4 (writing while hearing the melody twice) and 5 (writing after hearing the melody twice). Overall, written response accuracy for the six groups was 48\%. Subjects in groups that sang reproduced the melodies at a 43\% level of correctness.

Participants performed short melodies from memory on a keyboard while musical pitches that sounded in synchrony with each keypress (feedback contents) were altered. Results indicated that altering pitch contents can disrupt production, but only when altered pitches form a sequence that is structurally similar to the planned sequence. These experiments also addressed the role of musical skill: Experiments 1 and 3 included trained pianists; other experiments included participants with little or no musical training. Results were similar across both groups with respect to the disruptive effects of auditory feedback manipulations. These results support the idea that a common hierarchical representation guides sequences of actions and the perception of event sequences and that this coordination is not acquired from learned associations formed by musical skill acquisition.

Feedback direction was manipulated by presenting pitches that matched events intended for the past (delays; Experiments 1 and 3) or the future (prelays; Experiments 2 and 3). Feedback distance was manipulated by varying the absolute separation between the current event and the location of the feedback pitch. All alterations disrupted the accuracy of performance (pitch errors) more so than timing. Serial-ordering errors indicated confusions among proximal and metrically similar events, consistent with the predictions of an incremental planning model (Palmer \& Pfordresher, 2003). Patterns of serial-ordering errors suggested that performers compensate for the disruptive effects of altered feedback by changing event activations during planning.

  abstract = {"Few aspects of daily existence are untouched by technology. Learning and teaching music are no exceptions and arguably have been impacted as much or more than other areas of life. Digital technologies have come to affect music learning and teaching in profound ways, influencing how we create, listen, share, consume, and interact with music--and conceptualize musical practices and the musical experience. For a discipline as entrenched in tradition as music education, this has brought forth myriad views on what does and should constitute music learning and teaching. To tease out and elucidate some of the salient problems, interests, and issues, The Oxford Handbook of Technology and Music Education critically situates technology in relation to music education from a variety of perspectives--historical, philosophical, socio-cultural, pedagogical, musical, economic, policy--organized around four broad themes: Emergence and Evolution; Locations and Contexts: Social and Cultural Issues; Experiencing, Expressing, Learning and Teaching; and Competence, Credentialing, and Professional Development. Chapters from a highly diverse group of junior and senior scholars provide analyses of technology and music education through intersections of gender, theoretical perspective, geographical distribution, and relationship to the field. The Oxford Handbook of Technology and Music Education's dedication to diversity and forward-facing discussion promotes contrasting perspectives and conversational voices rather than reinforce traditional narratives and prevailing discourses."-- \$c Book jacket.},

Sapolsky's acclaimed and successful Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers features new chapters on how stress affects sleep and addiction, as well as new insights into anxiety and personality disorder and the impact of spirituality on managing stress.As Sapolsky explains, most of us do not lie awake at night worrying about whether we have leprosy or malaria. Instead, the diseases we fear-and the ones that plague us now-are illnesses brought on by the slow accumulation of damage, such as heart disease and cancer. When we worry or experience stress, our body turns on the same physiological responses that an animal's does, but we do not resolve conflict in the same way-through fighting or fleeing. Over time, this activation of a stress response makes us literally sick. Combining cutting-edge research with a healthy dose of good humor and practical advice, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers explains how prolonged stress causes or intensifies a range of physical and mental afflictions, including depression, ulcers, colitis, heart disease, and more. It also provides essential guidance to controlling our stress responses. This new edition promises to be the most comprehensive and engaging one yet.},

  abstract = {Since 1980 the amount of medical information has doubled approximately every second year. This implies that oral health students as well as professionals need to manage the flow of information rationally, in order to learn how to undertake evidence-based decision-making for diagnosis and treatment in a given patient situation. Current research indicates that computer connected databases and computer assisted learning (CAL) may enhance learning and provide the clinician with information for decision-making when treating patients. Multimedia for CAL, which combines audio and visual data in an interactive form, has proved to be an effective tool in education. CAL may supplement and reinforce more traditional learning and create opportunities to illustrate clinical situations in an interactive way. CAL has the potential to help students develop skills and knowledge. Students, staff and professionals consider CAL stimulating and motivating. Students easily adapt to CAL although their current computer literacy is still low. New authoring tools make it easier for faculties to develop their own CAL software. In the future we will see more sophisticated software with virtual patients who can communicate and interact with the student in a very realistic way. The software will even ``step out'' from the screen and help the student with clinical procedures. However, at present CAL should not replace traditional education, but rather be used more as a supplement and for self-directed studies.},

The goal of online learning is to make a sequence of accurate predictions given knowledge of the correct answer to previous prediction tasks and possibly additional available information. Online learning has been studied in several research fields including game theory, information theory, and machine learning. It also became of great interest to practitioners due the recent emergence of large scale applications such as online advertisement placement and online web ranking. In this survey we provide a modern overview of online learning. Our goal is to give the reader a sense of some of the interesting ideas and in particular to underscore the centrality of convexity in deriving efficient online learning algorithms.

  abstract = {Prior research studying the relationship between music training (MT) and more general cognitive faculties, such as visuospatial working memory (VSWM), often fails to include tests of musical memory. This may result in causal pathways between MT and other such variables being misrepresented, potentially explaining certain ambiguous findings in the literature concerning the relationship between MT and executive functions. Here we address this problem using latent variable modeling and causal modeling to study a triplet of variables related to working memory: MT, musical working memory (MWM), and VSWM. The triplet framing allows for the potential application of d-separation (similar to mediation analysis) and V-structure search, which is particularly useful since, in the absence of expensive randomized control trials, it can test causal hypotheses using cross-sectional data. We collected data from 148 participants using a battery of MWM and VSWM tasks as well as a MT questionnaire. Our results suggest: 1) VSWM and MT are unrelated, conditional on MWM; and 2) by implication, there is no far transfer between MT and VSWM without near transfer. However, the data are unable to distinguish an unambiguous causal structure. We conclude by discussing the possibility of extending these models to incorporate more complex or cyclic effects.},

  abstract = {A man of untiring energy and humor, Nicolas Slonimsky has led a long and accomplished musical life, and today in his nineties he is a vital presence in American music. In 1985, an extensive New Yorker profile described him as "a man of countless daffy stunts and almost as many authentic achievements." Indeed, Slonimsky pursued four distinct careers, each with its own degree of success: as a pianist, as a composer, as an pioneering conductor who championed modern American composers, among them Ives, Varese and Cowell, who long afterwards came to be acknowledged as giants of the new century. It was in his fourth career, as a musical lexicographer, that he achieved world-wide recognition, particularly as editor of the highly respected Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, a reference work renowned for its highly imaginative, lively, and gem-like entries.  He is also a master raconteur. In Perfect Pitch, his fast-paced and often hilarious autobiography, he recounts in fascinating detail a life that spans the whole of 20th-century music, ranging from his childhood in St. Petersburg, where he studied piano with his illustrious aunt, Isabelle Vengerova, to his years as secretary and "piano pounder" to Serge Koussevitzky, to his present career as musical lexicographer. He describes the extraordinary accomplishments of members of his family; Russia before, during, and after the Revolution; his successful appearances as conductor in Paris, Berlin, and New York, and his fall from grace at the Hollywood Bowl; the whimsical pleasures of lexicographical detective work; unexpected fame and fortune as a game show contestant; and much, much more. Along the way, the reader meets famous personalities as seen through Slonimsky's eye, names such as Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland, George Gershwin, Eugene Ormandy, Leonard Bernstein, John Cage, and Frank Zappa. Also included is the correspondence from Henry Cowell in prison, providing a stirring commentary on the persecution of this remarkable American musician.  Crowded with illuminating anecdotes, Perfect Pitch captures a life packed with odd and arcane developments, related in a style full of wit, spice, and irreverence."},

  abstract = {Purpose This review article provides a new perspective on the role of attention in auditory scene analysis. Method A framework for understanding how attention interacts with stimulus-driven processes to facilitate task goals is presented. Previously reported data obtained through behavioral and electrophysiological measures in adults with normal hearing are summarized to demonstrate attention effects on auditory perception---from passive processes that organize unattended input to attention effects that act at different levels of the system. Data will show that attention can sharpen stream organization toward behavioral goals, identify auditory events obscured by noise, and limit passive processing capacity. Conclusions A model of attention is provided that illustrates how the auditory system performs multilevel analyses that involve interactions between stimulus-driven input and top-down processes. Overall, these studies show that (a) stream segregation occurs automatically and sets the basis for auditory event formation; (b) attention interacts with automatic processing to facilitate task goals; and (c) information about unattended sounds is not lost when selecting one organization over another. Our results support a neural model that allows multiple sound organizations to be held in memory and accessed simultaneously through a balance of automatic and task-specific processes, allowing flexibility for navigating noisy environments with competing sound sources.

The Earth Mover's Distance can then be used for comparing point sets by determining how much work it would take to convert one of the point sets into the other by moving weight between the point sets., For evaluating how well this method and other methods agree with human perception of melodic similarity, we established a ground truth for the RISM A/II collection based on the opinions of human experts., The RISM A/II collection contains about half a million musical incipits. For 22 queries, we filtered the collection so that about 50 candidates per query were left, each of which we then presented to about 30 human experts (out of a group of 37 experts) for a final ranking. We present our filtering methods, the experiment design, the resulting ground truth, and a new measure (called ``Average Dynamic Recall'') that can be used for comparing different similarity measures with the ground truth.},

  abstract = {Spacing effects during retention of verbal information are easily obtained, and the effect size is large. Relatively little evidence exists on whether motor skill retention benefits from distributed practice, with even less evidence on complex motor skills. We taught a 17-note musical sequence on a piano to individuals without prior formal training. There were five lags between learning episodes: 0-, 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-min. After a 5-min retention interval, participants' performance was measured using three criteria: accuracy of note playing, consistency in pressure applied to the keys, and consistency in timing. No spacing effect was found, suggesting that the effect may not always be demonstrable for complex motor skills or non-verbal abilities (timing and motor skills). Additionally, we taught short phrases from five songs, using the same set of lags and retention interval, and did not find any spacing effect for accuracy of song reproduction. Our findings indicate that although the spacing effect is one of the most robust phenomena in the memory literature (as demonstrated by verbal learning studies), the effect may vary when considered in the novel realm of complex motor skills such as piano performance.},

  abstract = {Timbre is a multidimensional attribute of sound and depends to a large extent on its spectral content. The evaluation and control of timbre is a task commonly performed by sound engineers, loudspeaker designers, and subjects participating in listening tests on the quality of transmitted and reproduced sound. Such listening tasks require specific listening abilities.  This dissertation presents a training method that aims at developing memory for timbre, sensitivity to timbre changes, and listening strategies involving disciplined auditory attention and efficiency. The physical timbre space is divided into categories defined by the center frequency of standard octave and third-octave resonances. This simplification of the physical timbre space allows the memorization of a limited set of perceptual timbre categories or references that can be used to evaluate other timbres.  The proposed method combines the use of computer software for the presentation and evaluation of exercises and individual tutoring sessions with an instructor. The software monitors the actions of listeners during equalization adjustment tasks and allows data to be collected on the sequence of problem solving operators that are used. Performance indicators can thus be compiled and used for the assessment of skill level achieved by the listeners. A global performance index is proposed.  A listening test involving the adjustment of multiple peaks and dips in a sound\&\#39;s spectrum is presented, in which the performance of a group of experienced professionals involved in sound recording and audio post-production was compared with a group of student subjects with comparatively little listening experience but who were trained with the method described in the present work for a period of 6 months. Results indicate that overall the experimental student group outperformed the control group of professionals. Suggestions for further improvement of the training method and performance level assessment are proposed.},

Recent re-search has attempted to develop objective methods based on automated similarity algorithms, but there remains almost no data on the role of perceived similarity in mu-sic copyright decisions despite its crucial role in copy-right law. We collected perceptual data from 20 participants for 17 adjudicated copyright cases from the USA and Japan after editing the disputed sections to contain either full audio, melody only, or lyrics only. Due to the historical emphasis in legal opinions on melody as the key criterion for deciding infringement, we predicted that listening to melody-only versions would result in perceptual judgements that more closely matched actual past legal decisions. Surprisingly, however, we found no significant differences between the three conditions, with participants matching past decisions in between 50-60\% of cases in all three conditions. Automated algorithms designed to calculate melodic and audio similarity produced comparable results: both algorithms were able to match past decisions with identical accuracy of 71\% (12/17 cases). Analysis of cases that were difficult to classify suggests that melody, lyrics, and other factors sometimes interact in complex ways difficult to capture using quantitative metrics. We propose directions for further investigation of the role of similarity in music copy-right law using larger and more diverse samples of cases and enhanced methods, and adapting our perceptual experiment method to avoid relying for ground truth data only on court decisions (which may be subject to selection bias). Our results contribute to important practical debates, such as whether jury members should be allowed to listen to full audio recordings during copyright cases.},

We review the cognitive neuroscience literature of both motor and auditory domains, highlighting the value of studying interactions between these systems in a musical context, and propose some ideas concerning the role of the premotor cortex in integration of higher order features of music with appropriately timed and organized actions.},

The chapter presents a series of experiments on the role of memory in reasoning, language comprehension, and learning. An attempt is made to apply the comparable techniques in all three cases to allow a common pattern to emerge, if the same working memory system is operative in all three instances. The chapter makes a case for postulating the working memory-LTS system as a modification of the current STS-LTS view. Working memory represents a control system with limits on both its storage and processing capabilities, and has access to phonemically coded information (possibly by controlling a rehearsal buffer), that it is responsible for the limited memory span, but does not underlie the recency effect in free recall. The experiments presented in the chapter suggest that the phonemic rehearsal buffer plays a limited role in this process, but is by no means essential. These experiments also suggest that working memory plays a part in verbal reasoning and in prose comprehension. Understanding the detailed role of working memory in these tasks, however, must proceed hand-in-hand with an understanding of the tasks themselves.},

After seeing all the words in the list, the S is asked to recall them in any order one chooses. The experimental paradigm derives its name from the fact that the S is not constrained to recall items in a particular order. The free recall paradigm has recently attracted much research interest because of evidence indicating the strong influence of various types of conceptual organization upon the S's recall. This chapter outlines how several different strategies could be implemented in terms of FRAN's mental mechanisms. The fact that these various strategies can be formulated in terms of FRAN's machinery supports the assertion that FRAN models the structures and processes underlying human memory in general.},
