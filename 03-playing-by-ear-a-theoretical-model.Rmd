# Playing By Ear: A Theoretical Model {#theoretical-model}

As far as the author is aware, no computational model of playing by ear has been described in the music psychology, or related, literature(s). Thus, a first step in this thesis is to propose a theoretical model, which can then later be formulated more precisely as a computational model, then tested, partly with data collected throughout this thesis. 

However, related computational models have been described, for instance in the domain of aural skill acquisition [@bakerModelingMelodicDictation2019] and sung melodic recall by the author [@silasLearningRecallingMelodies2023; @silasSingingAbilityAssessment2023]. Theoretical cognitive models have also been described in the domain of singing accuracy [@pfordresherTheoreticalPerspectivesSinging2015]. Therefore, in this section, I will attempt to synthesise this literature to propose a corresponding model specifically for playing by ear skills. I distinguish between two basic playing by ear processes: a) playing by ear skill acquisition (learning) and b) playing by ear skill execution (recall).




## Bringing It Together

In sum, then, 


## Moving from Theoretical to Computational 

"When we develop a psychological theory that is sufficiently precise to be implemented as a computer program, we call it a computational model. The process of developing such theories, and implementing their corresponding computer programs, is then called computational modelling." [@harrisonMusicScience2025].



At this point, I already suggest a more specific feature to the model: that for playing by ear tasks, there exists a mental melodic "similarity" algorithm, housed in working memory. The input to this module is the target melody and the evolving real-time assessment of the melody being produced in the moment. The performer must hear the target melody, store this in short term memory as a reference, and then continuously update the target melody which each new note that is produced. I speculate that the mind recomputes the similarity between the presently number of recalled notes and the target melody iteratively, each time a new note is added. In other words, a check for the accuracy is made every time a note is recalled, and the presence of an error and its nature, will inform whether or not the performer stops to start again or continues to proceed recalling the melody, at least in the stage of learning. Formally:

### Inputs
- \( T = [t_1, t_2, \dots, t_n] \): TargetMelody of fixed length \( n \).
- \( R = [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k] \): RecalledMelody of length \( k \), unknown a priori.

### Sequential Construction
- \( T \) is fixed and built one note at a time.
- \( R \) is sequentially constructed one note at a time.

### Function Application
- At each step \( i \) (current length of \( R \)), the function **MelSim** is applied to **TargetMelody** and the current length of **RecalledMelody**.

## Mathematical Representation

Let:
- \( T_i \) be the prefix of the TargetMelody up to length \( i \), i.e., \( T_i = [t_1, t_2, \dots, t_i] \).
- \( R_i \) be the current state of the RecalledMelody of length \( i \), i.e., \( R_i = [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_i] \).
- \( \text{MelSim}(T_i, R_i) \) be the similarity function between the two melodies at length \( i \).

The MelSim function can be formulated as:

\[
\text{MelSim}(T_i, R_i) = f(T_i, R_i)
\]

Where:
- \( f \) is a similarity measure (e.g., distance function, alignment score).
- \( i \) iterates from 1 to \( n \), where \( n \) is the fixed length of the target melody.

## Algorithm Flow

1. Start with an empty recalled melody \( R \).
2. For each new note \( r_i \) added to \( R \):
   - Compute the similarity: \( \text{MelSim}(T_i, R_i) \) if \( i = n \).
3. Repeat until the entire recalled melody is constructed.

## Final Equation

The similarity calculation is performed only when the length of the **RecalledMelody** equals the fixed length of the **TargetMelody**. Therefore, the final equation is expressed as:

\[
\text{MelSim}(T, R_n) = f(T, R_n)
\]


I note that the `MelSim` algorithm is itself modular and of discussion in and of itself (cite M&F). For the purpose of this paper,


## Strategies

- Beyond scope of this dissertation to investigate in detail.
- Pop strategies hypotheses: [@liscioWatchingPopularMusicians2024]
- Also, we have our own text data, for later.


## The Melodic Mind as Item Bank

similar to @haston_playing_2022's concept of an "aural database"

- Big concept


## Predictions

- Simpler melodies will rely more on general working memory than musical working memory.
- In the short term (< 30 mins), melodies learned by sight will be less better retained than those
