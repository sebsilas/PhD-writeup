# Reviewing and spaced repetition {#reviewing_and_spaced_repetition}


# identify correct vs incorrect ngrams in a recall: add incorrect ngrams to beginning of session buffer
- prioritise those with temporal order
- prioritise those which are easier
- or, just incrementally test until each ngram is obtained from the beginning. e.g, if the target is, 60:65, first the participant must at least get 60:61; once this is got, 60:63 etc.. the program adds a note each time (or if the participant adds an additional extra note, the program could skip an n-gram)
